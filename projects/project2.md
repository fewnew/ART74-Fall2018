I wanted my video to showcase the warm feeling of people's smiles and at their best moments.
I also included other videos to show what warmth in nature felt like.
There is no real plot except for showing what nice feelings is. I wanted to have more aesthetic videos but it was harder to find people to film nicely. I used other videos from pexels.com and I thought the child and father really conveyed what happiness is like.
