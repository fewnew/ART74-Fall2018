Description: For this video, I was actually up rather late and short on ideas. My roommates all helped me by gathering footage of the shows they were currently watching, and I put them all together in a way that sort of just made aesthetic sense. During production I happened to find a common themee of weakness and anxiety, as well as a line that really jumped out at me: No matter where you are, everyone is always connected.
