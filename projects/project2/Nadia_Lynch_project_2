Description:

This is completely not what I had story boarded but still follows an idea that I had. I wanted to work with connection.
Peter Gabriel's music video for SledgeHammer is a direct inspiration by showing the connection of seemingly unrelated
things. There are a lot of animals because animals are rad and both people and animals have very interesting connections to
each other. The bridge between animal and human communication is so cool, as we learn our pet friend's body language and
their specific personality quirks.
For this I really wanted to play around with effects - I've used premiere before but never made anything abstract with it,
so using all of the weird visuals was really fun. I tried to make them appear similar to video glitches, documentary scenes and
in general just abstract. Not trippy or psychedelic.
