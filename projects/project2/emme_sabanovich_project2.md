Harmonizing Human Nature

This video art project was my first attempt ever to use software of any sort to make a video with use of different types 
of footage. The footage includes both videos and photgraphs I shot, and some oil paintings I painted, some of which I 
have moshed and turned into giphs as well. Using many techniques we are learning about in class (as best as I could) 
including the green screeen effect, along with some wonderful videos found on pexel, all of which have been incorportaed 
into text of the video. The main mood of the video strives to emphasize a feeling of peacefullness and calmness as 
well as a strong sence of communication amongst people through artistic expression of nature, colors, and sound. 
     There is also sybolism in the way artistic expression through paintings, nature, and communication itself 
mesh together in terms of humanity. It is only visually that we can actually separte them from one another, when in reality 
none could exisit witout the other. This is what I was trying to potray specifically with a moshed up version of both 
paintings and photos melting together into one physical entity. Overall, trying best to portray a sort of utopian vibe 
of the arts and human conection coinciding, and of coarse the choice of audio sound was meant to implement that snese of 
serenity too.
