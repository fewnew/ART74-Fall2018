- Awake - Jin, BTS Music Box

**Description:** I learned to feel a lot better once I began to see my inner flaws as freckles. I haven't yet grown to see them as stars, but I wanted to illustrate this self-love process with my video. Being used to Adobe Premiere, I wanted to focus on animation, something I've never done before.  

To start, I drew and sequenced all the animated parts in Clip Studio Paint. To convert the still image sequence into video, I imported and exported to .MP4 in Adobe Photoshop. I was unable to export my animation as an RBGA video, so instead, I made the background green and used ultra-key to overlay it onto some stock clips. For the accompanying music, I used a music box arrange of Awake, by Jin of BTS, which is about pushing on despite self-doubt.
