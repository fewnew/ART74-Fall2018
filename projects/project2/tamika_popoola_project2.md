**Description:** I learned to feel a lot better once I began to see my inner flaws as freckles. I haven't yet grown to see them as stars, but I wanted to illustrate this self-love process with my video. Being used to Adobe Premiere, I wanted to focus on animation, something I've never done before.
I was unable to export my animation as an RBGA video so instead, I made the background green and used ultra-key to overlay it onto some stock clips.
