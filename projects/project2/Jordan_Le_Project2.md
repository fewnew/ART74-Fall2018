From Nature to Urban is my title for my HypermediART project.  This video supposed to show me explore a few natural environments and a few urban environments.  It first shows a bubble freezing in a cold forest.  Second, a snail approaches.  Third, I saw a bee pollinating a flower at a grassy environment.  Fourth, I went to a tall grass area to enjoy the good view of a lake and a natural water fountain.  Fifth, I flew up and saw a road near by.  I saw a family taking a road trip in a car.  They were driving to an urban town.  I decided to follow the car on the road by flying.  I get to see the top veiw of the road within the forest.  I finally arrived to town and stopped flying.  The town was filled with people and cars.  I explored the town and found out it had a friendly environment.  After that, I opened my eyes to see myself sitting by a tree outside of my house.  I decided to go inside, as I was finished envisioning how life started from nature to urban.
