Description: <br>
For my video project, I took a sort of satirical turn on the world of motion video art. Often times we see obscure images in movies, scenes or videos which are supposed to be symbolic. I satirized these odd scenes by adding extra drama for good effect. The slow motion and choppy cuts mixed with the vintage filter added an over the top character yet there is little meaning behind the film. <br>

Overall, the mood is awkward, confusing as there is no clear plot. Though the music leads you to feel one way, yet the audience cannot help but feel another. As the obscure imagery leads you to feel in a reflecting manner, you still cannot get a clear picture on the whole story. The ending is so strange to play off the matter of how some ending scenes to movies are totally unrelated but people dig so deep into it, as if there was a symbolic meaning to it, yet there isnâ€™t. <br>
