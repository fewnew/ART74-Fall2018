Description:
My project definitely has a silly feeling to it. I wanted to create a refreshing video. My motivation behind making this video was based off how I don't like art to always have a deep and spiritual meaning. My old high school teacher would preach that if your art did not have a strong meaning, then there is no point of making art. I think it is okay to make seemingly meaningless art. I do not like to make serious art. I just want to stray away from art that is hiding behind a complex concept.

The intended purpose of this video was to make people feel happy.
I wanted to make people confused, but in a good way. I was trying to tell a story with the lyrics to the song, but this video is very open to interpretation. What you see is what it was meant to be and nothing more. My influences come from internet memes. I chose to use Kermit the Frog as my main actor for the video since his presence brings joy to viewers. The overall point of this video is that it is a pointless video.
