**Description**

Some parts of my project look odd. The idea was to use the crowd and traffic to represent a busy life that is sandwiched around social media. The rest of my motivation came from me wanting to learn how to use Premier Pro. I made the video silent because I do not want my audience to be distracted by audio stimulation, as some parts of the video are crowded or have a lot going on. This video is intended to be veiwed on a projector or somekind of electronic screen. <br>
