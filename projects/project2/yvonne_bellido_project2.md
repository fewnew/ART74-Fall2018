Description:

For my video project, I took an idea I have been having since I recorded my Grandmother singing last year. I wanted images of photographs with a voice over of my Grandmother's singing to give a sense of family and reminiscing on moments captured through a photograph. Photography is something I really love and it fascinates me how much you can say within a photograph without words. In this video, you see a woman looking back at all her family photos, her children, and her own mother. She then listens to the voice of her own mother singing and thinks about her own children. I intended on creating unity when you hear my Grandmother’s voice and how my mother reacts to it. This video ends with me taking a photo of my mother to continue on my theme of capturing memories. 

This project was created at my mother’s house and her kitchen gave good space to film. I felt very inspired by my own mother’s love for photography and her happiness that she gets when seeing a photo. I wanted to include the emotions of her face looking back at the many images I have taken. Overall, I really enjoyed editing and creating this project with the help of my family.
