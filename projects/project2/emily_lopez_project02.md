My video is meant to feel like a mystery, the viewer is not supposed to know what they are in store for. 
When the package shows up, it could be something scary or something magical (like the toothbrush). 
I drew my motivation from the documentary sieres I have been watching that take a similiar idea 
and make you wonder what you are going to see next. The intended context is when the final toothbrush scene occurs
and we see a creepy man, that makes the person in the film decide they do not want the toothbrush 
because of what creepy things they can come accross.
