# Lesley Gallinat - Project2

When I created this work, I didn't really have a concept in mind. I was focused primarily on learning the ins and outs of using 
Adobe Premiere Pro and experimenting with transitions. If I had to sum up the theme of this piece, I would have to say it is about Woman
Empowerment. Interpretation is at the viewer's own discretion.
