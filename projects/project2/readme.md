# Project 02: HypermediART
### :two: (video and sound art)

Create a short (60 seconds) video composed of four 15-second clips to tell a short story, illustrate a scene, or communicate a mood. Bring your imagination out to play using media assets such as the original sounds, music, narrative voice, text and graphics. Think critically about horizontal/vertical format when you are recording and how you want the final output consumed by your viewers. The rules are simple, but the possibilities are endless!
