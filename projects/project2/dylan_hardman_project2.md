This video takes some visual style cues from my own work in film making while also borrowing elements from comedic skits I have seen on the internet.  It has the look of a typical skit/short film with sounds that are very contrasting in both calm and sad tones.  The music drives the emotion of this video as it helps the audience empathize with the character.  It is intended to be viewed from a somewhat comedic perspective as this is partly a fun way to mimic other comedic skits online.  The audience should experience it as such, in an informal setting where they are free to laugh without judgement.
