# Title: Crazy Art

## Medium:
Processing/p5.js

## Dimensions:
Desktop Screen

## Description:

For this project, I wanted to do something abstract and random. I messed around with the animated bubbles in the example code and in the end made some sort of crazy keyboard art. The bubbles turned into thick lines but they are still animated. When you click on the keyboard, a new color of the lines pop up which in the end covers the whole scrren until you press another key. It gets crazy when you start pressing a ton of keys at the same time creating cool color mixtures.
