# Vanessa Zamora - Project 1 
The theme that I want to convey for project 1 is "Technology." I picked to do my collage on technology for many reasons.
We are surrounded by technology. Technology makes our lives better and easier and it also connects people. Technology can range 
from a cellphone, a tablet, a laptop, a smart watch and so many more things. Now a days technology is so advanced and you are
able to do so much. Technology has helped so much in the health and medical field by saving many lives. Every so often there are 
new advances in technology.
