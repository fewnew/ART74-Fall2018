**Description:** 

My project looks like space! The Earth is a bit large for the scale I am going for, but I enlarged it so you would be able to see it well enough to make out what it is. The motivation/idea behind the project was space exploration, specifically deeper into space. The intended context is within a gallery that the class is hosting at the school and it also has an augmented reality portion to experience via smartphone. My influence for this was just some of my own recent interest in space and the idea of moon colonies. I also believe that space exploration should not be forgotten, as it has the potential to be a new environment to develop new technologies that can be used on Earth.
