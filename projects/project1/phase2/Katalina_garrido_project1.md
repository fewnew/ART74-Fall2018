My Piece is called modern religion
My medium is digital media using photoshop and illustrator
I created this piece because I always like using art historical references in my art. I am not the most religious person so this icons in this piece are mainly for aesthetic purposes.
I chose the word modern because recently on Tumblr, there has been certain trends of cool toned statues being distorted as art and since the works of art were religious, I thought it be fit to title this piece that.
It was fun creating this as I got to incorporate what I deemed visually pleasing and the effects chosen added to the depth of the piece.<br>
