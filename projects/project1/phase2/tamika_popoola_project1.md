**Description:** Again, Min Yoongi, AKA Suga, from BTS, is my favorite rapper. 134340 (Pluto) is a song about having used to matter to someone, but while they've discarded you, you can't stop revolving around them. Seesaw is a song about a relationship that has grown cold and resentful, but neither party has had the guts or resolve to break it off. Never Mind is a personal rap about SUGA's life, the hardship he's faced, and how he continues to move forward. I relate to these tracks, and they've helped me a lot, so I've incorporated visual and lyrical elements from them into my collage and AR overlay.
