My piece is an exercise in Absurdism and the frustration when reaching the paradoxical conclusion of it. Absurdism is a study of 
throught which focuses on the conflict humans face when trying to find meaning in something where there is no meaning at all. An excellent 
example of this is the kids' TV series Spongebob Squarepants. The show is set in the ocean under water, yet the characters often do actions
that are physically impossible, such as starting fires, operating electrical equipment without getting fatally shocked, using plumbing like
faucets and toilets, even flooding. <br>
None of this is possible in the real world, yet it does not detract from the quality of the humor. Seems the only way to enjoy the show is 
to simply turn off your brain and just go with the flow, much like most of us do when watching TV in general.
