# Hao Rong - Project1

It is important to stay hydrated. We need two liters of water a day, but it's very easy to forget to drink, especially when we are busy working on something. My collage is strongly water themed, hopefully this gives the viewer an urge to drink. The gaming chair in the bottom left is tied into popular culture. There is a saying in the gaming community to "stay hydrated between the games", which is the inspiration for this project.

### Title: Stay Hydrated <br>
