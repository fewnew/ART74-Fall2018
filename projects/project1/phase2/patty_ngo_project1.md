# Patty Ngo - Project 1

My work is based off a song from the KPop boy group, Stray Kids. The song is called "Grow Up" and the lyrics are about not giving up and pushing through your problems. These lyrics really motivate me, especially in college. In my project, my main character is a member of this group. I added some images to create a space theme. This represented darkness, or the times in your life where you may feel down. In order to represent the good experiences, I decided to transform my space themed collage into a bright daytime scene using AR.
