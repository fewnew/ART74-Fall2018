Title: A Helping Hand 
Medium: Print on Paper With AR Overlay
Dimensions: 8.5”x8.5”
Description: 
For this work, I decided to create a display of overcoming adversity.  The red lines that make up the background represent my struggle with pain and loss, while the black lines represent the emptiness I felt during this time in my life.  There are two hands that are shown in the center of the work.  This is meant to represent the support that I received from my friends and family during this hardship.  One of the hands is pictured passing an eye to the other hand, symbolizing the passing of wisdom and knowledge that has helped me heal.  “This could be…”  is shown in the center, alluding to the idea that, through everything, my potential remains intact, and I still have the capability of making something of myself.   However, the moon in the background suggests that despite the vast amount of support that I received, there will always be some amount of darkness that I will never be able to escape.
