# Emme Sabanovich- Project 1
For this project my work is restricted due to my extreme unfamiliarity with this medium. 
However, my images within the collage tend to convey the feeling of despair and suffocating frustration this project is making me feel. 
The images of the robots are in representation of technology replacing people and a more natural way of life, 
seperating me from the beauty of nature creating sad eyes and melancholy sound eluding from the photograph of my piano. 
I used a combination of photgraphs that I took personally and altered in shape, along with specific images I searched for online.
I did my best to use the tools in Adobe Illistrator to try and create some sort of painting effects in the middle of the collage, unsure of how to use the tools given.
