# Issac Maya: Project 1 <br>
***

Description: This project felt like I'm contibuting my pieces of my travels to share with others. And it felt like by looking at this, I really miss the times I've done and want to relive them again. 
The motivation of the collage is to learn more of the world by visiting them and learn how it works even when being sidetracked when having a good time.
The context of this is exciting, fun, astounding, curious and memorable.
My traveling eperiences govern me to make this piece since most of my work or projects were from these iconic pieces that gave me the idea to reveal it.
By combining my past travels from last year and this year, I can tell others to go and experience it for themselves. Life is short.
