Description:
After playing around with a few processing examples, I was able to eventually create a theme for this project. I decided to go for a theme in repetition and gave me an idea on what ideas and shapes would come into mind. I thought of circular motions and wanted to create an interactive movement between the mouse and movement of interaction. I also used a cool tone for colors, like green, yellow, and blue to familiarize an earthy vibe. In addition, my favorite inspiration for using this program was to have the opportunity to freely move around in this atmosphere. As a hidden factor, I was able to add a key press option, where if you pressed a random key, an ellipse would show up in a random color. With a different colored ellipse in a different place, you can see why I included the repetition of having different colored ellipses, but in a repetitive area of interaction. 

The functions for this piece includes:
Pressing any random key: an ellipse will appear in a random color and place (symbolizing a different planet)
One left click: the function of changing the time of day from Day to Night
Movement around the canvas: symbolizing stars around the universe

For the title of this project, I aimed toward how planets would cycle and repeat traveling around another planet where it related to the relationship with time and how we experience a new hour every day, month, year, and so on. With this, it creates a continuous thought about how the hour restarts with a new one and eventually a new day. The theme for repetition created an idea for how earth along with planets in space experience the same cycle as we do too. I felt like this was a great creative process to make because of how I was able to practice and interact with a repetitive message for life. Overall, I found this piece fun to make and to also have the option to create a fun activity.
