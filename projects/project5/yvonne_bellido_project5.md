#### Artist's Description: 
For this project I decided to explore movement with processing. I was able to create a bit of a theme for this project of what shapes and motions to use. For my first piece, I made a drawing with a structure of movement around a circle. I used cool tone of colors like mint green, light blue, pink, and yellow. Being really new to this program I tried my best to be able to add intresting processing techinques. For my last piece, I decided to make a simplistic and interactive drawing. Using the mouse will make black lines appear and follow wherever the mouse will go. Overall, I found this project interesting to make and it was fun to see what I created.
