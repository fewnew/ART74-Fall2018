#### Artist's Description: 
For this project I took inspiration from the holiday season. With this right around the corner from the time of writing this I thought it would be fun to create an interactive piece of art that reflects the crazy nature of the season. In turn what appears to be a simple snowman at first, once clicked becomes a spontaneous color strobing image out of control. When clicked you can also move the hand and extend the arm. As a p5js script, this piece of art is meant to be viewed on the web. But upon first using it is supposed to catch the user off guard, as one would not expect much from this cute little cartoon snowman in a semmingly normal landscape. It is all a representation of the hectic nature of the holidays.
