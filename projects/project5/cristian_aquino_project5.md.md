# Cristian Aquino - Project 05 (ArtWare)

Title of the work: Follow Me!
Medium: HTML/CSS/Processing/P5.js

**Description**
Using a cropped scan from Kozue Amano's seminal manga publication "ARIA" as the base, I coded in a pixel sorting script to organize the pixels of the image by hue from top to bottom. Watching it work in real time is much more interesting than a static image, isn't it?
