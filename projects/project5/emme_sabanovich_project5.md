###Description:
With use of sample movement P5js, then altered by color and arrangement of movement.
When you look into the atmosphere you don't always see what is there. Have you ever 
thought of the concept that particles could be seen as different colors depending on their 
surroundings and the atmosphere they are within? This particle color assignment touches upon that very idea. 
Atmosphere is key to state of mind and therfore, so are the colorful particles of our atmosphere. Movement has 
been slowed down, and colors are changing continuosly, there is interaction through click of the mouse 
that actually moves the particle dots around, showing how we have a significant play in attributing to 
our atmosphere surroundings and therfore enviroment.
