# Ttile: Crazy Art

## Medium:
P5.js

## Dimensions:
Desktop screen

## Description:
For this project, I wanted to focus on making a crazy visual using p5.js. During my time looking through the examples on the p5 editor, I was able to pick a couple and manipulate them into making original artwork. The end result turned out to be thick lines moving around the screen bouncing on the edges. Also, when you click on any key, the color of the lines changes making the colors crazy and fun to mess with.
