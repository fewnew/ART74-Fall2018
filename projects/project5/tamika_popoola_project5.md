**Description:** 
I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar II, so it's been on my mind lately. Looking retrospectively, it's made my time in school and college hard, academically and socially. Relationships are the hardest/the worst, because people misunderstand me and think I'm just sad, grumpy, a downer, excitable, loud, or childish when I don't mean to be at all, and I have less of a control over these things than normal people do.

I began to wonder: how would one even communicate Bipolar disorder? And so I explored that with this project. Using different colors and animations to represent the various states a bipolar person cycles through.
