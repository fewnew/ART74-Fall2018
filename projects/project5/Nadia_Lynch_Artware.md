#### About:
While I enjoyed working with p5js a lot more than html; it sure keeps me on my toes with creative problem solving. 
The snow animation is a taken example from the P5JS website which I then changed the speed which in turn made it fall faster and in a more linear fashion. I then took examples of half circles and made them placed to appear as snow piles. Finals are on the horizon and the change in student morale is tangible just walking through campus. I've been excited since August to see this campus change over winte - while we don't get snow the changes are still very exciting. I would enjoy to see snow even if it was just small piles around campus that melted not long after setting. So I suppose this modified example is just a whistful wish for snow.
