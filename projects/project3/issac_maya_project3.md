## About: <br> 
I took the bunny from Meshmixer and sculpted it to turn it into a different creature.A mutated crearue, so dangerous to the world and it had to be isolated, alone in nowhere. I used a volcanoe to make it look like it was going to be extinct but the volcanoe didn't turn out to be a volcanoe. Instead I used the volcanoes into rock mountains, since it is scavaging for food. Until a triangular meteor is about to hit the creature. I used the triangle from Meshmixer to sculpt it too. Giving it a different form.
