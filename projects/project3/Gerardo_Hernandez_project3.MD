Description:
I wanted to create a scene that most action movies would have. The typical muscle car trying to evade the police while going through the city obstacles. I also gave it a dramatic scene with sketchfab which makes it a lot more exciting. The VR is set right in the back of the cars so you can get a good view of it. My motivation for this project pretty much had to do with the fact that I was watching an action movie in netflix and wanted to recreate that exact same scene.
