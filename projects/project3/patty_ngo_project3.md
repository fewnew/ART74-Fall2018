### About: 
I had this beautiful character named Onion Baby that had a cute vibe to him. He was inspired by Bao from the Pixar short film and also the Korean character Apeach. Since it is spooky season I wanted to create something spooky in my 3D scene. I incorporated my cute character into this sligtly ominous scene. When you look at my scene in VR, you are transported into an unsettling situation.
