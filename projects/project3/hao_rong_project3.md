#### Dimensions:
Screen Size

#### Description:
My project originates from the idea of geometrical objects floating in the sky. I gave the objects a broken material and used an image of tree bark as the normal map. The VR is positioned on the "ground" of this scene, so when the viewer look up, the objects above them would appear to be huge. The larger objects in the sky somewhat resembles viruses; paired with the uncomfortable colors, it makes up a disgusting experience.
