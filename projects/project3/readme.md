# Project 03: 3D MeshMash
### :three: (remix) 

Using three objects/forms that are from both existing and found (downloaded from the internet) sources, mix together a virtual 3D sculpture using Meshmixer. Design the impossible! Your mashup may be an exciting re-interpretation of a classic form or even a chaotic mess made of organic and/or geometric designs. You are also required to visualize the purpose and "story" behind the objects that you choose to model. The final work must be submitted to https://sketchfab.com/. Once you have it uploaded there modify and edit your 3D Mashup using the panels and menus on Sketchfab. Create an emersive VR scene by rescaling your work and changing the avatar's position.
