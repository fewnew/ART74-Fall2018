**Description:** With this digital 3D sculpture, I wanted to represent the life of one of my original characters, which isn't exactly as it seems. On top of keeping up with her studies as a freshman in college, she gets pulled into a millenniums-old battle between light and darkness, order and chaos, and must use sacred magic to protect her city.

I hope that upon looking at this scene in VR, the viewer is familiar with some of the objects scattered across Amity's desk, and is able to relate and put themselves in her place. At the same time, I want the first aid kit to be confusing, the wand to look strange, and the fact that she owns a gun to be completely out of character compared to her laptop, notebook, textbooks, and sewing machine. These items don't feel like they belong to one cohesive concept of an individual, but we as people are multifaceted, and who we are as a whole is a cross between stained-glass art, and shattered glass strewn across the floor.
