Title: A place to call home
When originally creating this piece I wanted to make something new but also something that felt vintage. I used warm tones to make the piece
more lively and grain to create that antique style. I was thinking of an old space video game called " Spore". I used very long fillae and indents 
create texture in hopes that it would look like a futuristic home.
