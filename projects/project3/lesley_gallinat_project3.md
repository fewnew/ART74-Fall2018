## About: <br> 
Took a 3D image of a banana peel, experimented with it in mesh mixer until I made a weird shape I liked. The end result was a gnarled twisted
thing that looked deformed and diseased, but in a cool kind of way. Then I exported it to Sketchfab and 
did some more weird stuff in editing until I liked what I saw. Kind of looks like a stream of liquid mercury floating in space. No profound message
with this scene; just having fun with shape, color, and texture.
