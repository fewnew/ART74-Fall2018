Hi Everyone! 
Here is my project. I wanted what I did in meshmaker to look cool and spooky in time for Halloween, but feel creepy enough that it stands by itself.
I wanted it to feel like an open experience yet still feel like there wasn't enough space. With brighter lighting the forms of hands and heads looked creepy, but when
covered in a darker color - the forms become creepy but more subtle. I enjoy spooky stuff, but I want horror to be more environment based and in atmosphere - i find jump scares
really really boring. I think neutralizing fear in visually overwhelming and atypical things will allow for greater appreciation in scary stuff and help show alternative forms of 
alternative beauty. okie thanks 4 readin'.
