## Into the Rabbit Hole

#### Medium:

#### Dimensions
##### Smartphone Screen or Desktop
#### Models from poly.google.com

#### Artist's Description: 
My project follows the influence of an otherworldly place, almost like what Alice and Wonderland brings.  As the title is inspired by that story so is my 3D model. The world you step into when in VR is that of weird creatures and landscapes.  The creatures are mixes of different species as is many of the creatures in the Alice in Wonderland world.  It is meant to be viewed from the immersion of VR in order to feel as if you have fell down the rabbit hole into this other world.  A fantasy experience.
