#### Description:
This is a website showcasing my work done in Art74. The website is built using the Bootstrap and Cube Portfolio plugins, and heavily customized. I want a clean look for my website, so I chose to go for a sleek one-pager. The website is modular, so it can be expanded easily. A filter can also be added to make navigation easier. The QR code, and optionally contact information can be added in the footer. A return to top button is also included in the Cube Portfolio framework.
