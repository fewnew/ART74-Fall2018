### Description: <br>
This webstie was created to showcase all of my art work from Art 74. I wanted to take a minimalistic look for my website so my art would be the focus. I didn't want nothing to distract the eye so anyone can reflect on what my art means to them and my message. The homepage animated sketch was created on treejsplayground.com by playing with the codes and colors. I made sure to also have my homepage linked to my projects and my instagram. A user can simply click to see a project or reture back to the start or jump between projects. At the end of my website I included a hub of all my mini projects. These are all my assignments in images formed together to look like a collage. In the end, I connected my website in Github and to a domain so anyone can have access to see it.
