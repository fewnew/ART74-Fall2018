Title of work: Elizabeth Kim | Portfolio <br>
Medium: Web/HTML/CSS <br>
Attribution:Geometry on homepage made in Three JS Playground <br>
All other works are my own <br>

<p> In this project we were tasked to create a webpage using html and css code that we had written on our own or borrowed from another source. I feel like I did not learn much from this project other than importing fonts and using them in css. On the homepage one will see a geometry rotating that was made in three JS playground. On each page of my website you will be led back to the homepage and to other projects. I hope that this webpage can serve as a basis for my portfolio in the future and that I will imrpove and expand it.
