Description: For this project, I made my index page with collage background of Disney parks I've visited within two years. 
The animation on the index is a knot with a blue background moving around. And the project links and Instagram icon is colored red.
The project link pages have a light blue color backround with my previous projects I've made this year. Along with the mini projects that I made 
for class. I provied the images for mini projects is using imgur since it was easy to use instead of using a jpg photo 
where one can find on a desktop.
