**Description:** 
Oh man this was really hard for me, I'm for certain not an HTML/coding person - the errors aren't fun for me to work out and just end up frustrating me. It was a good thing to do for me though! I have to take a couple more website designs before getting my A.A at Foothill College, so this was a good way to get me working with it again. Personally for my actual portfolio - I just use weebly and the premade themes there and personalize it through the website. I think it would be really important for me to continue to work through my frustrations with HTML instead of avoiding it. I couldn't get the domain to work, but the site works over at the git hub page, please take a look over here!
