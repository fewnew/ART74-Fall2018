Description:
<br>
Throughout creating this website, I was able to use the website, called threejsplaygnd, to create a geometric shape that would transform and rotate while viewing the Home Page. I was able to use codings through atom to design the atmosphere of my projects. I also wanted to create a strong tone of colors that I felt was relevant to my personality and the projects I have created, so far. From the codings that w3schools provided, I was able to create simple links to another page that shows the progress of my work. The use of coding was really interesting to learn about and to actually apply to my website. For the mini projects page, I was able to use a template provided that allowed images of my small assignments to present a small part of what they are all about.
