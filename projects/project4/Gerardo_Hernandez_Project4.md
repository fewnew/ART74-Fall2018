Project 4: efolio
Gerardo Hernandez ART74 Portfolio Website

Medium:
HTML

Dimensions:
Desktop

Description:
While in th eprocess of this project I felt a bit lost but after some time I got used to HTML. Within this website I have variouse projects and assignments that I have created over the course of my 2018 fall semester. I like the fact that I have all of my digital media art projects in one page and this really makes everything much more organized. Even though it took quite a while to get all of my prjects together, it was really worth it. It is a simple website which is the way I wanted it to be. That way it is not to ddificult to get around. I might tinker more with it a little to improve more on the visuals and UI. Overall this was an enjoyable project and thinking back on it, it wasnt as difficult as it seems.
