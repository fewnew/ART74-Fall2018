#### Artist's Description: 
This is a website portfolio of my art work from ART 74.  It includes all of my previous projects linked below a Javascript image as buttons that link to their respective pages.  Below those links are icons linked to my social media accounts.  The Javascript image you are presented with on the main page of my website consists of a spinning polygon.  This polygon is constructed out of several different cylinders that are in wireframe mesh rather than solid, also with a rainbow-like hue to them.  It is meant to suggest that you look into the shape, due to its transparency, allowing you to feel as if the cylinders don't lead anywhere as they are in an infinite loop.  The rest of the website follows a basic structure that I feel is easy for users to follow, as navigation icons are recognizable and simple.  Embeded links to some of my projects make it more accessible for the user to view my art without leaving the webpage.  One of the pages even includes a gallery of the smaller projects I have done for the class.
