## About: <br>
I created a website to hold my portfolio containing all of the projects that I have completed thus far. I wanted take a minimalistic approach for the basic skeleton on my website so my art would pop out. On the home page, I made an animated sketch on threejsplayground.com by playing around with different codes and aesthetics. Below, I linked my projects and my instagram for easy access. Within my projects, the user can click to return back home, or jump forward or backwards to the next or previous project. Included in my projects is also a tab called mini projects which are pieced togehter in a collage format.
