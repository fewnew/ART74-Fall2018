Medium: Web/HTML/CSS 
All Works are peices I put together 

Creating this webpage ended up being a lot more difficult for me than anticipated. I had a lot of trouble with the coding. My overall final project I am very proud of because it took so much time to understand when and where to place certain code. My webpage is made up of all the projects I did throughout the semester.
