Im not to fimiliar with javascrip but it does seem to be fairly simple especially compared to other kinds of coding programs I have used.
The reading did make me come up with a couple of questions. At a glance it all seemed very confusing. Its interesting that there are very 
different techniques one can use to somehow toi shorten code or atleast seem to make it a bit more organized. Converting some code to 
another kind is also interesting. I think that would only work if the programming language came from the same root? I would think so anyways
Im not to deep into programming.

The other thing is the ability to so much with code considering what we are doing in class. i thought that there wasnt as much supprt into 
this such as having variouse text in order to draw using programming. Its very intimadating actually becuase Id say one would have to alter
there original plan to something else in order to accomadate the lack of skill in java. While pencil and paper is probably the easiest way 
to put your thoughts on paper. Now imagine having to do it by code. Its almost like starting to learn holding a pencil.
