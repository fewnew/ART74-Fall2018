The github page is very helpful for coding. It has a bunch of information like coding commands and information about javascript. There's a 
lot of helpful examples given on the page that you can copy and paste on your own code to use. 

The most helpful thing on the page are the given examples on the page. The page has codes that are like template where you can put your own
properties then copy and paste it for your own code which is kind of cool because you can use it in your own code for your own artwork.
