Overall, I found this page on GitHub a bit confusing to read. Clearly this is an intro to another program and has something to do with codes. I am not too comfortable with coding yet so not all of this made sense to me, epecially JavaScript. <br>

The only thing that I found interesting in this informational page is the facct that htese codes are like templates. I like the idea of artists being able to take other people's work and maniuplate it to be their own. This page and all of its instructions reminded me og threejsplayground, where we made our skethces for our websites.
