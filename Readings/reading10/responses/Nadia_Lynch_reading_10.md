	When I think of Javascript I mostly look back to having to enable it to run certain elements on a page. Looking at Javascript is similar to reading HTML in a sense; you can follow along and have a pretty good understanding of what the code represents - with the exception of not having a visual up to value scales when briefly reading over the codes. 
To me the conversion seems like a similar relationship that HTML had to CSS - even with the usage of asterisks. I really like the set up the conversion follows, however Iâ€™m certain there will still be was to be confused by this. That in mind, I still feel more sure stating that I found processing to be more creatively encouraging than HTML, especially with the ability to instantly run code and work through mistakes as opposed to having to work through multiple pages and an index file.
