As a continuation of my rant in reading 9, my opinion still stands about the Processing language as a whole, and now continuing into the p5 language using the JavaScript library.  p5 to me is a weird language because it is a language built off JavaScript which is a version of Java for the web.  The result of this being is nearly the same platform with near identical syntax to Processing.  Case and point this was fairly simple for me to understand.

What was helpful from this reading was the differences in the syntax between Processing and p5.  While these are mostly syntax differences between Java and Javascript, it is still nice to have a refresher of how my code should look.  It was also interesting to see how different programming concepts can be used in the p5 language for art purposes.
