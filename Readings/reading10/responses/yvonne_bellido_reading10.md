For this reading reflection we had to read a GitHub article on processing tranitions and p5.js language. The Processing language has a lot of information that I did not know anything about. I've just recently been introduced to these computer lanuages. The reading was very helpful with with example formulas and thinking of the coding das a sketch one is drawing on a canvas. There are so many ways to be creative with this lauage and make art. It is amazing to see how a few words and numbers grouped together can create action and images.

The coding can create size, color, shape, images, movement, etc. I can see how confusing this coding would be with trial and error having to be in play. The article was very informative and gave clear instructions, like the threejsplayground, to be able to easily create. The lanugage works a bit like the HTML and CSS coding we did in class. This has helped me be able to understand Processing and I am hoping to get more familiar with this new language.
