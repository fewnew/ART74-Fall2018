The p5.js have changed many of the programs when working on one, like the size to create canvas. These new 
information of transitions and programming of the p5.js has things that I can barely understand. Although I can understand
a coupe of these programs when designing a webpage with coding. But the setup coding in global mode is tricky for me to understand since
I never done global mode efore. This can be new to me and another program coding when converting a processing sketch.

The variables are the same problems when solving numbers. Coding relates with mathmatics to know what are the calculations
to make a program to p5.js. For example, variable x equals 100.3. This is something that is from algebra 2. To understand processing data on a program is to use a graphing calculator to 
know the answer to the problem.
