After reading this article about the changes and differences for Processing language, I feel like I learned a lot. I found it really useful to learn more and take more notes for this program that would enhance my skills and use for beginners to use this program. It is also really interesting to learn new ways about the elements that can help create and contribute to this, such as including sketches and being able to resize them with a followed code. I also found mousing and their movements interesting to look at because of how there are several different effects for it. Throughout the codes, it felt very familiar because of what we had learned in class and from the previous reading about this program. 

From the examples of converting a processing sketch to p5.js, I would have never thought that these codes looked intimidating to work with, but it does change and affect your sketches significantly. It was also really interesting to see “function drawSegment” instead of the simple coding we used for our website. I also found it really interesting to learn more about the variables used that are shortened but can demonstrate something significant for the object you are creating. Overall, I found this really helpful and I am able to have a sense of what the p5.js is all about.
