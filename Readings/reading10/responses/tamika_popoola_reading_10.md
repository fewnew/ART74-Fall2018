So I'm guessing Processing is like, a JavaScript library, or similar to JavaScript? Which willll make it pleasant to learn. It's cool that there's a wiki page for it, and that GitHub allows for users to create wikis around repositories. It seems to be based on visuals and graphics, which will be new to me because I'm used to creating those "by hand" as opposed to coding them to existence. (With the exception of CSS.)

The fact that the text strings work like HTML and the styling works like CSS is going to be *very* handy. It also makes sense as to why one would give a Processing canvas a class: you can target it with CSS after. The ability to create 3D primitives with WebGL is interesting too. As I'm not as familiar with Processing as I am with HTML and CSS, instead of playing-it-by-ear, I'm probably going to refer back to this wiki page a lot.
