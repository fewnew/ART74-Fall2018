I found this reading really informative and helpful. I never really read much about Augmented reality and would typically just acknowledge a broad concept for it. It is fascinating that they are all digital and has a story to it. The fact that the devices act as a “multisensory interface organs” to augment with the viewer’s body is also a great way to casually introduce this concept. Technology is advancing and the fact that it uses our phone screen to virtually experience this with our body movements makes a great invention. In addition, the fact that AR art also focuses on a perception while doing so is also really intriguing to think about.  

Even though I have never really thought about AR art, reading about Tamiko Thiel and Mark Skwarek contributions had demonstrated the various works to make this successful. The fact that dimensions were also looked at really makes AR fascinating to experience. I also find it really helpful when artists brought up social issues like climate change. Overall, it feels like this has been successful and has introduced new ways to present art visually. In conclusion, this has really opened up my perspective towards AR.
