Augmented Reality, or AR, is a form of
digital media art in which the artist
creates a work using code or some type
of computer language or commands to
create an interactive piece which requires
the use of "mediated unveiling."
It is not a traditional type of art in
that the artist does not use tangible media
such as paints, pencils, canvas, paper, etc.
The artist is making something invisible
that requires an electronic computer source
to activate and view.
The best example of how this work is
created most people who are technologically
inclined are probably already using in
their everyday lives. Our phones can be used to
scan barcodes to purchase items as
an alternative to using credit cards.
I used mine this morning to pay for my
coffee at Starbucks. I opened the app
to the barcode on my screen and scanned
it with their scanner at the register.
The result: $4.10 was removed from my
account and an order for a cappuccino
was sent to the electronic ordering
program at the store.
