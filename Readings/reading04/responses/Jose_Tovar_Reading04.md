The paintings and creative works at the art museum were very interesting and thought-provoking. The one that looked amazing and very detailed was the creation of miniature houses on a hill/mountain. The detail that was put into it made it look so realistic. I just couldnâ€™t keep my eyes off of it. The houses were very also very realistic and even had windows where you could look through the inside of the house. Another artwork that stuck with me were the shapes in the beginning of the tour. It looked awesome with the low lighting. Overall, the trip was very enjoyable.
