AR is a type of digital art. No AR work is visible without using some type of computing device like a smartphone. AR is a type of mixed reality experience which mixes the real world with something artificially placed there in your view. VR wants the body to disappear and for you to be transformed to somewhere else, but AR art wants to become part of the art experience as if it was some kind of revealing performance. 
I find AR art very interesting, as it is a sort of new media medium that we can experiment with. It can make something hard to make without a physical projector easier to do and places the experience within the viewerâ€™s hands. They can move around and interact with the art piece in a new way. For example, you can make a butterfly fly across the whole room in all dimensions, rather than be confined to what could be projected onto a wall.
