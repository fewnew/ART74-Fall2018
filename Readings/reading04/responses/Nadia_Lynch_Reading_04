	Amanda Goulding of Duke University explores the possibilities and technical aspects of augmented reality (AR) artwork - AR being defined as pieces of art expression that complicate traditional norms and consist of invisible visualities. AR is digital form of art that lays in a spectrum of performance and presentation: augmented reality works with immersion through multisensory engagements, requiring the creation to always have a viewer to interact with as the experience is part of the premise and art process of AR.
In the process of creation an AR artist will play with the code programming of geolocation (the service of finding a real world object or your own location) and edit the information as well as add to it - creating new distortion and qualities to an image. AR seeks to connect the mind to the body with the subjects manifesting around the viewer. For better understanding, an  example of AR art would be being at the beach and using a compatible application on your phone to view around the beach surroundings to then find an animated seal flopping around. What would make this experience unique is if you moved around the seal your view of it would changes - perhaps you go around it and see the back of it or walk far from it and it becomes smaller as you leave its location. 
When thinking about AR in my personal life the most instant example that comes to mind is Pokemon Go, when you use AR mode it will show the pokemon in front of you or where your camera was first pointed before you turned on the scene. You can walk around the pokemon and it continues to occupy the space it was assigned to. This can make for funny images, many users would post their funny experiences, such as: A caterpie appeared on their dinner or a gyarados shows up in someone’s shower. I believe other than the premise of Pokemon Go (an app that encourages exercise through users having to walk to a pokemon’s location) this featured scaled high on the level of interest.  I’m not aware of any other apps that did this at the time, but in the experience of Pokemon Go, I would safely assume it was many people’s first experience with AR as it was mine. This was a fabulously crafted sense of immersion - many people since the inception of pokemon games dreamed of having a real pokemon before them - much like AR art -Pokemon Go connected people’s minds to their bodies. 
I would be very interested in playing with AR art but my coding skills are not polished nor advanced, though Goulding duly notes that AR artists often work with programmers in a team setting. This collaboration to me is heartwarming; Everyone can be part of the artistic process, art is becoming more accessible to people and no longer locking out potential artists due to their ability or lack thereof to draw classically or technically.
