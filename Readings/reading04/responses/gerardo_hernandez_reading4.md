I really liked the field trip and was overall really fun. I have three art pieces that stood out to me and that had to be the little houses on the mountain, the weaving picture of flowers, and the calming scenery projectors in the dark room. It was very relaxing and interesting how the colors look. The image I want to talk about is the projected images from the dark room. I like the blue hues and how the dark shades can really make any kind of color pop. It looks almost as if you're in a vast forest and is somehow sunrise.
This was my very first art gallery i've been to and I will say that I will more than likely be going to many more in other places. I would always think of these galleries a bit boring but I was proved wrong. There are really very fascinating pieces and can really open your mind and creativity. I enjoyed going to the museum with all of my peers and would do so again.
