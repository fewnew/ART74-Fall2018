The recent article we read I learned about augmented reality art and media ecology. In the past, I have heard about augmented reality, but never really knew it could be used as art. It was very interesting to learn about Tamiko Thiel, a digital visual artist pioneer. He has used the field to address important global issues, climate change and start a conversation. It was also interesting to learn that that augmented reality art could be used within dance. This has really opened my mind to what augmented reality art can really do.
