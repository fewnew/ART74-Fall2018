AR tech is kinda like, Alice in Wonderland: Through the looking glass, haha. I'm used to it already because it's on the 3DS' camera, as well as Pokemon GO. I wonder if it counts as sort of a *digital vandalism*. Sort of like, tagging, but in a totally safe, nondestructive way.

People can add upon, or add social commentary to, their surroundings this way, so, we might even study AR art in the future. Or look at AR dinosaurs. Or bring ruins to life with it. I dunno! But it'll definitely be something students have to study in art history classes in the far future.

I've never considered URL QR codes to be AR, though! :O
