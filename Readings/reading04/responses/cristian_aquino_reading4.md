AR Art seems pretty interesting and versatile in the context that this article
puts it in. Being able to use real life locations as part of the piece
or modern technology as the lense through which people view it through
opens the door to a wide variety of things to talk about. I can see AR Art
being especially interesting live, since no two viewers will have the same
experience with it. I also find its practical usage interestingâ€”making museum
visits more fun and interactive is a great way to keep art and other
cultural heritage interesting for the modern audience, as well as future
generations. Blurring the line between what's reality and artifice; AR art is
pretty cool.
