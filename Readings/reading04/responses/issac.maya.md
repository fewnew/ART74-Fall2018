This reading was very helpful when it comes to reality and augmented reality. AR is a form of expression that complicates traditional notions between
the real world and virtual by bringing it to life. This reading actually made sense with augmented reality when someone wants things from the virtual
world to the real world. This hasn't been done before because people lack the time and effort to make it happen since it's the 21st century. AR's immaterial
manifestations is the subject that is affective to the body and the mobile media.

In a way, the devices acts as a multisensory interface organs which makes it safe, depending if people can handle it. The network puts the heart at
work, if capable. What makes it amazing is its ability to asethetically manifest that many theorists that tried to make it come to life. Eventually, it'll
happen when someone intelligent enough at a young age can bring about it to reality of AR.
