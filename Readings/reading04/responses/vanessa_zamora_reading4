  After reading 4, I learned a lot about augmented reality art and all there is to it. I learned the definition of augmented 
reality art and what it is, which is an art form of artistic expression that complicated traditional notions of the visual 
arts. Augmented reality art can be seen in many ways like on the computer or ones smartphone. I also thought it was cool to
find out how exactly is it that it works when you scan a barcode using your smartphone. And the way that, that works 
by one scanning the barcode and and then the screen on the smartphone reveals the physical scene. 

  Something that also called my attention was when they mentioned virtual reality. How they mention that virtual reality 
involves cutting yourself off from the real world in order to immerse yourself in a computer generated virtual work, 
augmented reality involves overlaying a virtual world onto your view of the real world, so that you can experience both at
the same time and I understand that and see what they are saying. I have a virtual reality headset for PS4 and I think it is
so cool how you basically go and explore a whole new world virtually.
