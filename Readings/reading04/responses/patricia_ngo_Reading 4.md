This reading is all about augmented reality and the artistic value of this concept. The article explains the differences between AR and VR, which is something I have wondered for a while. This reading refers to AR as an art form rather than just a concept used in digital media. AR really ties physical and digital forms together. The usage of AR is definitely evolving and will continue to evolve for many years.
When I think of augmented reality, I think of the temporary alteration of the real world. In the past, I have used augmented reality to create animated photos. This was a fun assignment to create because it involved using Photoshop and after effects to turn a still image into a beautiful animation. I think it is really interesting to see reality being changed in a way that you can interact with. I think this type of technology is evolving into something that can benefit us.
