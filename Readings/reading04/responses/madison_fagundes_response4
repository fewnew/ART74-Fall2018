Augmented Reality is an incredible new art form that takes art from the canvas, to the world.  AR opens up limitles possibilites for artists to express themselves.  The world is their canvas... Literally.  Additionally, AR allows the audience of a piece to step into a completely different world, even if it is only for a limited amount of time.  It creates an escape for not only the artist, but the audience as well.  As AR continues to become more and more popular around the world, it will continue to affect others in a positive manner, and will allow for the world to grow positively as a whole.
