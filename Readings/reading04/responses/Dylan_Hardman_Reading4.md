The essay, titled “Invisible visualities: Augmented reality art and the contemporary media ecology,” discusses the use of AR (Augmented Reality) in the function of art.  
This technology has the potential to drastically change or even create a new form of art.  As explained in the essay it has served a variety of uses in today’s art from 
museum art and archival works, to work in activism and performance art.  It accomplishes so much because of the fact that AR layers virtual images onto the real world 
which doesn’t require the same space that tangible art requires.

After reading this essay, even after already knowing about AR prior, I see promise in what it can bring to an artistic and more functional use cases.  Due to the un 
tangibleness of AR work it makes it easy and also efficient to add more information to the physical world we live in without actually doing so.  One example of this is 
showing the future of sustainable development.  I also found it interesting how AR could function collectively with objects in the real world with the dance performance 
example in mind.  This has had, and will probably continue to have, continued development in the video game industry, with more games that could be played out in the 
real world.  This is the future of artistic technology and also practical development of our society and it will be interesting to see what form it will take in years 
to come knowing what it is already being used for.
