AR is a relatively new technology that somehow gained traction over VR. It's as much as an instrument of art as it is a tool for better quality of life. When we look through AR lenses, we are, quite literally, seeing something out of nothing. Because AR is an augmentation of reality, it's use is limited to reality. This sounds redundant but it is important to realize. This means the most appealing part of AR as an instrument of art is it's ability to visualize the past. When we go visit old buildings, ancient civilizations, ruins, we are visiting the remnants of the past. But wouldn't it be nice to see these things in their prime time? That's where AR art comes in. It can allow us to "live" the past while physically being there.

Other forms of AR art also exists. For example, creating AR markers out of seemingly random objects, or interacting with invisible AR partners, but these mostly play into the "cool" factor. To me, none of these can be as impactful as experiencing history. We've had some ways of simulating VR, like being inside a room of screens. The Jurassic Park rollercoaster is known for the realism with 3D glasses and giant screens, but imagine that with AR goggles instead. AR might be as close as we can get to real 3D holograms, for now at least.
