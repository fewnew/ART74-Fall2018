After seeing the Hunch infographic, I now see how they gathered such a broad audience. The usage of infographics are great since they are visually pleasing while also getting the main points in a simple fashion. Infographics are a very effective way in gathering people’s attention and keeping them entertained with the images simultaneously. If they were to add the same information out in a normal, black and white document, it would be a complete failure since it’ll be less appealing without the vibrant colors and images that infographics use.
A targeted audience also has to be in effect in order to successfully get your ideas out. But with editorial content, it is much more easy to obtain the broader audience attention from the get-go because it’s so appealing to more people. I now see why more and more companies are using this style in order to get their ideas out to the audiences.
