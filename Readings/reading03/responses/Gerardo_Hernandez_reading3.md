  Many organizations use infographics in order to communicate with their audience/customers. I really like the way infographics are able to deliver a message without many words and more with the images it represents. It's simple, informative, and straight to the point. I took a lot from this reading especially on the part of knowing your audience before creating your message. One really can't make everyone happy thus should stick to the people that they are targeting.

  Even though it's a difficult task to do it is possible to target all the people who look at your infographic. Still I think when one is trying to target a broader audience it can get boring or repetitive to the targeted audience. In the end the infographic will be bloated with information and not be as appealing to many. I really like this reading since it can also be related as a business concept.
