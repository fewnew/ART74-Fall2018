  Infographic is a way a company or industry can communicate to their audience or their clients in order to relay out certain information, I think this is an awesome way to catch the audiences attention. It is easier to get the concept out to the audience for them to easily understand the message. The more edited the content is, they will have a more broader audience. No matter the size of the audience, it has been proven that the audience has a better understanding of what the company is trying to communicate.
  
  The targeted audience tends to differentiate between a broader audience. A targeted audience will find the information more useful and interesting rather than the broader audience. Most companys treat there audience as equal and in order to get the attention of the braod audience they generally use editorial content to relay their message to not only the targeted audience but also the broader audience.
