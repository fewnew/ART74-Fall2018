The reading detailed the powers and limitations of brand-centric and editorial
style infographics. It all sort of works in my head, but seeing the
science behind art's practical usage being broken down into math problems
on the page makes the concepts seem a lot more difficult and black/white
than they actually are. Infographics seem a lot more commercialized and
business-orientated than I gave them credit for. Like all forms of media,
theres a time, place and usage for them, but the author of this piece insists
that they're specialized for selling products or ideas to a wide range of
audiences; a quick and consumable way to put an idea in someone's head.
