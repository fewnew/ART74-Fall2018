Infographics is the designer's way of presenting data. Presenting a large amount of information in a easy way is a true study of art. Finding a balance between art and information is tricky. If there is too little graphics, it becomes boring and unattractive. If there is too much art, it becomes tedious to look at. Many times I see people overdo the art, and the entire thing becomes too cluttered to be useful. Depending on the target audience, infographics can look very different while presenting the exact same information. By using graphics that cater to a specific group of people, it can massively increase interest and thus increase the effectiveness of the infographic. We see this commonly in marketing.

Infographics are typically more graphics than information. When we glance at infographics, the first thing we notice are the charts and lines, not the smaller text and numbers. Marketers take advantage of this by exaggerating the scale of the chart. For example, 50% and 51% are very close, but in the charts we might see a big difference. Other times, we might see mis-matched charts. Such as a bar chart for true and false statements. Because most people don't bother taking a closer look at infographics, these intentionally misleading marketing techniques can be quite effective.
