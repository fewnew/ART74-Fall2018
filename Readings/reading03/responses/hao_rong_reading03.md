First I have to say this website is very cool and fitting for the theme. I learned a lot from the video, specifically about data bending. I keep hearing about the term but never knew what it was about. I used to think glitch art is art made to look like glitches, much like pixel art, but now I know it's actually made through exploiting glitches.

So this hypermedia essay carried lots of information, some I agree with and some not. He has a point about glitch art being the rebellious and anarchist way of acting against control. I've seen glitch art so many times before but never made the association. Glitch art is often used by "hackers" in games and movies, and I thought it was just to be cool, but now that he says it, it actually does come together.

However, I do not personally agree with glitch art being a form of art now knowing the significance behind it. Originally, I thought it was cool and unique, and like many other things this makes glitch art artistic. But now this video essay changed my mind, I now think glitch art has more political/cultural significance than artistic. Actually, I think glitch art gave itself a bad reputation because of its prevalence among rebellious folks, "hackers", and the likes.
