The simplicity of an infographic is what catches the eyes of the audience. It displays an easily-interpreted visualization of something using a simple graphic. I think infographics are essential to things like marketing and branding. Infographics are easy to comprehend and doesn't take much effort to know what's happening in the picture. It's straightforward. I fin it interesting how I am just realizing how infographics are all around us in everyday life. It's at places like the restaurant where they show you a logo of a chicken leg to let you know that it's chicken or at places like television, advertising, and many more.
I found infographic intriguing that the creators want to target a broad audience instead of a specific one. I think it's amazing how broad the audience are for infographics because it is just so easy to understand. I personally prefer to have these visuals so I can understand a certain material better. It's just easier to understand when you can visualize something.
