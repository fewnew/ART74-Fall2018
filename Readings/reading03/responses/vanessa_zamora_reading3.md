After I finished reading, I think it is very cool how businesses and well anyone can use infographics to target and attract an
audience. In the reading I also learned to see the targeted audience as the x-axis and the content as the y-axis. I think 
infographics are great and a better way to target an audience because of all the visuals it can have. An infographic 
can consist of many words, ranging from different fonts and sizes to different pictures. Infographics are easy to read and
very appealing. They can easily catch your attention. I think infographics can catch your  attention much better and faster 
than having something written with a bunch of words. An infographic which has more visuals is great to catch the audiences 
attention. 

I think that when creating an infographic or whenever I see one they tend to use the biggest size and font for the more 
important stuff and small fonts for the less important stuff. I think it is great how some inofgraophice are only made up 
of purely visuals and you still know what is it exactly that they are trying to say and what point they are trying to get 
across.
