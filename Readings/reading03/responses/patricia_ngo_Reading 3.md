Using infographics are a great way to provide information to a consumer who prefers visuals over written or verbal information. This effectively communicates the creator’s thoughts to the intended audience. I noticed that all the infographic shown have the main idea in bold letters and pictures to support this main idea. I found it interesting that the article brought up the fact that the creators of these infographics treats all the members of their audience equally in order to reach a broader audience. They don’t really target a specific group if the group does not bring the creator enough attention 
I personally prefer my information to come with graphics that help me visualise the ideas in my head. When I try to remember information, I find it easier to think of a photo rather than words. Infographics and visual storytelling seamlessly blend images and words together in a way that I can understand. I also think that the bright colors and fonts are more attractive and appealing. As a consumer, I would be more drawn to products that are associated with bright colors and fun graphics.
