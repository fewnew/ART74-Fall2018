	Infographics are a powerful tool of design used to quickly and efficiently communicate information: the purpose of the infographic is flexible and can be used to express anything assigned to. While they follow design principle models - they often do not stand alone but rather in support with text and other graphics. Infographics are commonly seen alongside data and help to translate the data into visuals, taking potentially complex information to then producing an image...in simple terms they make information more digestible through supporting illustration. </p>
	Infographics work through linking content to its targeted audience and a more broad audience. Infographics are also not limited to only being educational about a specific topic - they can also communicate brand-centric information such as: brand values, location, products reports, presentations and more. These can help to create brand interest and buzz and further bring in more audiences.
	Though the graphic art may look simple to visually consume - but it’s still a complex and difficult exercise. The challenges include how to condense images into simplified forms (over detailed graphics create visual clutter and work against easy consumption) that also pair and support the information being reported. In some examples a clear or over detailed pieces don’t factor as much from the silhouettes being enough visual data to process, in example: A burger or hotdog are easily identified even when blacked out - we are able to recognize the shape not only from previous context but also more than likely from seeing other graphic images of hotdogs or hamburgers.
	I find graphic imaging to be a very complex form of design - the research data aspect is also impressive but often done by a different team and not left up for the designers to sift through. Interpreting data and then creating a map that best illustrates it isn’t a simple challenge. Even with the consideration of the how to translate information into images (note: the infographics are not substitute for data but provide supplemental visuals) there’s still the aspect of creating all the images - between a team or solo. 
My experience with creating infographics was very elementary but still took critical thought. We were given the graphics but were allowed to write the information about ourselves (as an introduction assignment) - so thinking of placement and order was a crucial consideration. Sometimes even what application you use can make a project more streamlined or more haggard. I personally dislike using Illustrator as my intuition is stronger in free drawing - so I can see that also as a big component to infographic development creation.
