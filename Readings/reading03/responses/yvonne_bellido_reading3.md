  In the recent article we read I learned about understanding the visual storytelling spectrum. To understand this concept it is good to remember the target and broad audiences as x-axis while brandcentric and editorial content is y-axis. Infographics are a way to reach specific objectives and audiences. It can reach consumers who can be informed visually and generate attention. The article had many infographic examples with bold letters and pictures to show the main idea. 
  I found it interesting that many businesses and brands use these concepts to inform a target. Brand-centric content means explanation for business and communicates its values. While editorial content is the material thatâ€™s used to tell a story. The infographic examples showed the visual storytelling seamlessly. I could see how consumers would be drawn into brands that use the fun colors and graphics.
