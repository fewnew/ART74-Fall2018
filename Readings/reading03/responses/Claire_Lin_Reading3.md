After reading this Article, i believe that it was really interesting to read about the whole spectrum for visual storytelling. I do agree with the fact that there needs to be a main purpose and what it primarily focuses about. I also believe that people are highly focused on common topics that actually apply and relate to them to fully read what is being communicated to them. If the story was directed to a broader audience, it would still treat the audience as an equal to those who can actually relate to the story. As this concept was being described, I found it fascinating that this could be graphed and mathematically seen on a X and Y axis to calculate the success for the story.   

When this theory was put to the test, an example of how liberals and conservatives were being compared with food, made an interesting story and attracted a lot of audience. Because of the visuals and information calculated, this demonstrated the difference and common grounds for what both parties would eat and prefer. I find these type of articles and stories resourceful because you can really see a good estimate of what is intended for the audience to read. I personally enjoyed reading the visuals and information for the class of 2011 social media high school yearbook and how the visuals did not crash into others but more of an open space and limitation of what to show.
