So from what I can tell infographics is
kind of like an online picture book.
It can be used to present data that
may be very boring or appreciated
by only a small number of viewers in a
visually stunning way that delights
the senses. Infographics are fun little
mash ups of fonts, images, and graphic
designs used for everything from super
boring statistics to BuzzFeed-worthy
articles on how to spot a yelp reviewer.
The article also mentioned stuff about
editorial content and a graph
showing the relationship to content
and audience viewership, but looked
suspiciously like an algebra problem,
so I stopped reading. I've spent 15 years
strategically avoiding any activity that
requires knowledge and execution of any
and all algebraic formulas, and I intend
to keep it that way thank you very much.
