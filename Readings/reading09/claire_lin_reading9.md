After watching the first video introduction about Processing, I felt surprised and really interested in learning more with what the program has to offer. The fact that digital media projects are created through this program makes the use for making projects easily made and easy going for creators online to make their projects. I found it really helpful when Dan was able to explain the brief overviews of what you can do with Processing. As I went on to learn more about how to adjust shapes by the width and height, it was really interesting to think about it through pixels instead of inches or feet.

The ability to make and create shapes through coordinates of measurements also make processing easy to calculate. In addition to making an interactive project, the functions that were needed was able to read color and fill in the shapes for what we wanted the shapes to look like. 
In a way, the use for coding also reminded me of how we would code for our websites. This also introduces a new idea of adding certain features you would want to include. I really enjoyed how wherever the mouse went, the circles would follow the movement for it. In conclusion, I really enjoyed learning more about basic interactions through this program.
