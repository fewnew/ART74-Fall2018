In the video of color, I knew that there could be two colors in shapes. For example, the rectangle. The rectangle has
the stroke and the fill, which is the outline and the interior. But in order to call or make a shape is to filland set the stroke
before it is called the shape function. Like black is the stroke and yellow is the fill. That is where order of operations matter.

Another thing that facinates programming is the app called Strata #3 by Quayola. An animation
that combines computer generated images with video. That is really amazing to make animation with the camera with digital images to make a video.
