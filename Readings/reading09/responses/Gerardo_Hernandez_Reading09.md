While watching the videos it made me think of the variouse ways code is used during my learning phase. Even though I had a general idea of 
creating art through coding it is still very satisfying to me. I wonder if there are any kind of limitation to what a person can do with
this sort of method. Im pretty sure it will be more effective If we were to draw shapes in an external program. which in any case its 
almost the same thing except we do the drawings first and the outcome is the code generating in the background. While in this case we would 
have to code and our end result would be the drawings. It is stil a very helpful to know that this kind of method works.

Even though the way it is used for is still a bit strange to me. I want to see actual full completed projects using this kind of method. 
Can we create images using this method. Is this the way we can create games?Is there any other coding software than jave in order to achieve this?
It deffinetly is different from other kinds of coding software. Atleast to me it seems to be much simple and straight to the point. There has to be
some kind of draw back using this kind of method. In general Im pretty sure the use of this program is ment to be something different than drawings. 
Ill probably do reaserch more about art using code.
