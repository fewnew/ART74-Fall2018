      Through watching these video tutorials on processing, I have been introduced to a whole new concept in relation to digital art. It is very interesting how there is a mathematical twist in creating coding for such works of art. There are many different formulas that create different results for canvas size, background, fill ( color) etc., all in which then are able to create very beautiful works of art, some of which were very similar to an end result that looked like abstract paintings, which I enjoyed the most. 
      
      Dan was extremely enthusiastic and upbeat about the learning process of processing. The fact that there are very literal cause to an effect is ironically very  mechanical in terms of creating art, however I canâ€™t help but be intrigued by the results and I am very curious of how these formulas create such huge and theatrical pieces used for installation art. I also found it very interesting that there is already been use of    processing software programing that actually creates jewelry that is then made physical with the use of 3D printing in correlation to this software ( very cool).  There are so many ways to use coding and computer software processing to enhance creativity and works of art on a larger level at a much higher pace I am interested in learning more.
