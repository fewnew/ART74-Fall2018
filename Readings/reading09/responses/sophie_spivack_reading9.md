I found this video not only very interesting but also very helpful as it taught me the essentials about Processing. I enjoyed learning the basics about this program and it intrigues me to learn more. I like how easy it makes projects for other artists as there are options to collab and more. <br>

Using measurments and small calculations to create and design reminds me of coding as there is room to be percise. I like how this feel like an extension to our website design as there we focused on the asethetics and functions of the website. Overall, I am interested in earning more about this program so I can add it to my arsenal of tools.
