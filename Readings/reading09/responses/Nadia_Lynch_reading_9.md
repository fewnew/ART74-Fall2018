This was a really fun way to learn processing and to get involved with coding in an interactive sense. When we learn processing and coding through a more traditional academic sense; passion can be killed before even ignited due to how difficult and frustrating this learning process can be. Processing is a form of digital hands-on playing, perhaps people who like learning with their hands or by doing are those who will excel in this field.
What I really enjoyed about this interactive tutorial was how fun the host was and while he was excitable and passionate - there was no sense of being patronized for learning beginner techniques. I think that as a beginner is all I could really ask for, to have it be understood by the pro that itâ€™s difficult and frustrating but to take the time to play without any real pressure or consequences.He also reminded me of Bill Nye!
