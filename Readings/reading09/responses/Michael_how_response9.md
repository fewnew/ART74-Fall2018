Coding is being able to give commands and functions in order for the computer to know what to do. For example he gave us the rectangle and the function was called Rect, and when that is called into the code it will display it. In order for that to happen it must contain size of the shape and location on the canvas as well. Same for any other piece of code, it must need a function in order for it to be called.
