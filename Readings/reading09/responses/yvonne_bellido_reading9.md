For this reflection we had to watch introduction videos about Processing. The videos were all on how coding can help us create art. I was amazing to see how many artist are using the medium to add contemporary digital aesthetics to classical art and get a modern twist. They are also using this medium in art installations and creating a new world. The software environment called Processing was created by artists and designers to create visual media. I do not have much experience 

I found is helpful that Dan was very enthusiastic and gave good overviews on making shapes, color and interaction with Processing. This way of coding is also how someone would code for websites. I really saw a similarity because of the website project we created. In the end, I really enjoyed learning about the basics of this program and what one can do with it.
