The video is has a lot of information and it helps me the important tools of processing. It showed me the things I needed to know and the
basics of processing which was really helpful. It interest me more to code and it's also so cool that some artist do it so good.

The use of precise calculations is used to create and design is like when we code in class. You have to be precise and precise with your 
coding in order for the final picture to work. The website itself is so cool with its features in the title page where the cell like thingies
react to your cursor. It makes me want to design my own website just like it.
