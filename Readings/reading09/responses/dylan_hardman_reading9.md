In our futher discussion of programming as a medium for art, this video teaches us the basics of coding in Processing.  While I am not familiar with Processing as a programming language, I am familiar with Java, the language it is based off of.  Almost all of the coding I have done over the past two and a half years has been in Java.  Processing itself touches the surface of what is possible with that language.

Due to this fact, this video while informative, is not extremely useful for me in understanding how Processing works.  The Processing language is a stripped down version of Java, making it very accessible and easy to understand for first time programmers.  The only thing helpful to me was the sliht syntax difference, but the over-arching programming concepts remain the same with functions, methods, variable, loops and so on and so forth.
