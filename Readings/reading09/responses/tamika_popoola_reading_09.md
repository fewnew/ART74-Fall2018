This tutorial guy sure is excited/eccentric.

I wonder if the examples were made with "processing", or just code in other software, like Blender or Unity. I wonder, what even is "processing"? Is it its own coding language, is it a nickname for another language like JavaScript, or is it a nickname for getting code to do work for you in general?

As someone who studies graphic design and wants to be a graphic novel author, we often see things like "processing" as the things that'll run us all out of business once AI gets smart enough to come up with the creative ideas to "process" on its own. But in reality, I don't think computers can be creative. They can only follow instructions, so I guess processing is just another thing for us artists to learn and inject our own creative ideas into, and spins and touches onto.

As someone who has taken a Python class, and mucked about in JavaScript, I feel pretty comfortable.

Many a time have a ruined code by putting the lines or sections in the wrong order.
