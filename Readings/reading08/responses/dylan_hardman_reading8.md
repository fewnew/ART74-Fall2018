To my understanding generative software is any piece of software used to generate art.  This is just the gist of what of it, but the main point is that generative art is kind of out of the artists' control.  The art is created from predefined parameters that the computer interprets to make the art itself.  This differs, however, from software art.  

Software art remains in the control of the artist, because the art is not generated by software.  Instead the software is the art, which is in turn created by the artist through code.  This is an interesting connection to what we have done in class because of our work with web programming.  We have used code to create art throuh 3js playground which is in turn software art for the web.  You can even consider web design a type of software art because of its source in user controlled code.
