Looking into software art and generative art really makes me consider the different reaches of art; Having once picked up one of my Dad’s old books titled Digital Design, I expected to see instructions on how to use Photoshop for illustration. Instead I saw a bunch of code being explained and shown how it worked - I was massively confused - how could this be digital design when it wasn’t art!? 

	Working with the glitch art, VR and HTML/CSS has really helped me to expand my horizons of understanding that there are multiple processes: causing me to be aware of my ignorance thinking illustration was the main element of art. I can’t help but wonder why there’s a sort of rejection between art methods and classifications, for instance: generative art isn’t software art.
  
I think these debates between what makes a process valid or a piece of art is what completely steers me away from looking at contemporary art - I don’t like having to follow rules for enjoying art, consuming it or creating it - art to me was always the exact process of freedom. Through this class I’ve been thinking a lot more on what art personally means to me, seeing how different highlighted artists and guest speakers we have. 

With this survey of looking at digital design in the focus of code and software, I can’t help but feel that I’ve been completely blind and naive - I promote how proud I am to have grown up a millennial with technology evolving as I aged, yet I don’t work much with the technology that defines me. 

My sibling and I often lament about how we wished our Dad taught us coding or computer technical stuff when we were younger so we would have had an easier entrance to digital industry. It brings a wave of peace over me to see how well this type of art is documented - at any time I could dig into this history and try to learn it. I’m growing a larger sense of how older forms of art and technology are still highly interactable without a sense of nostalgia chasing.
