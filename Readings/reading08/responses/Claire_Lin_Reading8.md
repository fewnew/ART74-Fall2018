From reading this article, I was surprised to hear about how there was actual art that connects to the use of softwares. With the transformation of using softwares, we are able to create art in various ways to present our creativity. I feel like this article was great to read about because of how we are working on our own portfolios through coding. Coding is unpredictable because we never know what the outcome of a design will turn out to, but with the option of editing and making small changes are essential tools for a project. Because of the use of software art, people have the ability to successfully change HTML codes, details for the website they are coding, and much more, which makes it really fun to make.

I find this reading great to learn about because there is a difference between generative and software art. One field of art is more specific than the other and establishes the differences between the different use of arts, like how generative art is more pragmatic and neutral while the software is more connected with culture and more into an experimental aspect. The history behind these two fields of art was also introduced during the Berlin Media festival, which makes it even more influential because of how it has shaped history today and the use for coding in our country. Overall, this reading was great to understand more of generative and software art.
