So I'm guessing, software art is art in which the context of the software used to make it... adds to it? And open-source software is more favorable because it allows people to look into/alter the source code for themselves?

Walser.php seems like, re-interpretive art, I guess? With it's soft "piracy" it certainly is political, I suppose, with how it gets through the loophole of copyright.

It's not generative art because it's less about... the book itself as it has been reinterpreted but more about how with the right software, you can turn the code back into the book it started from. I think.

I think generative art is more about the end result but software art is more about each step of the way, and often has some kind of sociopolitical commentary to it instead of just looking pretty or cool.

Also, in software art, it's more about what the code does, whereas generative art made with computers is like "woah, look at this code, look at these patterns we don't understand, but yet are so beautiful. Isn't it cool?"
