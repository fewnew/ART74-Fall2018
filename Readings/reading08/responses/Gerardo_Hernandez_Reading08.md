While reading the article it reminded me of the variouse techniques we used in order to create digital art using our own computers. Even though
im pretty sure it is something totally different I cant help but to think of it as the process we did by doing our glitch art projects. The use
of software in our daily lives is mostly to be more producytive. There are other programs out there that in general are more art oriented such
as photshop and other art creating software. To be able to code to make visuals is something much more technical. Coding to others is for 
software development end never to create visuals suing actual code. Atleast thats the way I took it by reading this article.

I wonder of any other art projects that are made using such methods. It makes me think if the art made using the code give the abilty to create 
their peice truly how they wanted to. In example in coding if something doesnt work or run, one would have to alternate the code or at times 
scrap their original plan and make a new method. Same way with making their art. Can they trully make what they intentionally want? or do they 
have to at times alter their code in order to get similar results. Leading them to end uo with something completely different then what they 
originaly had in mind?
