After reading the article, I started to think about how useful and impactful technology is for us in our everyday lives. Generative and Software art was something that I thought would be similar in the way of the structure but now I see how totally different they are in their own ways.

Software art is used in ways dealt with coding extensively, while generative art doesn’t really cover any code that much. The article was very interesting to me because at the moment we’re coding in class so it was nice being able to relate to something that’s very cool to me.
