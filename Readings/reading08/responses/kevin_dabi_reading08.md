Generative software is the exercise of using a computer program or any other machine to produce a piece of art. The process is done by

On the other hand, software art focuses on the generative part of the art, which is basically the generation of a material. Software is
experimental and non pragmatic. Software art is what makes the aesthetics art from the software.

The article is very interesting and complex at the same time. Coding is still a very complex topic for me to understand because of its

have a better sense of it.
