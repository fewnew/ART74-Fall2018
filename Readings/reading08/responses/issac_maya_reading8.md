After reading the article, I never thought that both generative and software art has different perspectives of how coding works. Never knew that software art has different structures and code architectures. But it is
amazing that it is found in different contexts like media art festivals, architecture and others. 
I also noticed that art can be connected in the software, like making a website, kinda like making an e-portfolio. 

One of the other parts of the reading that I find interesting is that walser.php has been called a politcal software. 
Since the weblink was made into a political site that addresses political issues in different parts of the globe. 
For example, President Nixon's involvement in the Watergate case. 
The software in this context was made to is to be seen as a pragmatic-generative tool for results without being questioned.
