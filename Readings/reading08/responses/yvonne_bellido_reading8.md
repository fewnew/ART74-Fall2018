From reading this article, I learned more about generative art and software art. Generative art is any art practice where an artist uses a system, like a set of natural language rules, which set motion of autonomy to result in a completed work of art. Generative and software art have different perspective of coding. Software art is an artistic activity in the material of software allows for critical reflection of software. Software art has a different structure and code program. 

It is amazing to see that this art is found in art festivals, architecture, and other medias. I found this information to be very interesting because this art is in around our everyday lives. I am not really experiences with coding, so this really helped me understand on how coding works more. I really see how software art is about the code doing things, and generative art is understanding the computer. This art can be used to make something amazing or to address important political issues.
