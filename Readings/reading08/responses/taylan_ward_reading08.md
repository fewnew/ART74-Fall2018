By the name of a man Philip Galanter brings up a term Generative art. He said that Generative art is any art that is being used by a system. This means it can be used by a computer program, a machine of any sort or any other procedural invention. Which this will be set into motion to a completed art. I believe that I usually spend lots of my time with generative art and usually the future generation usually spend most of their time with generative art.

I haven't seen that many people actually use another art form than generative art because it is so common that people either use a machine or invention to construct art because it is so more efficient and it is way easier to handle. I mean don't get me wrong lots of people still do art the old way by finger painting or any other types of hand held tools to help them make art but if you want a job in a big company or somewhere knowing how to use generative art can get you anywhere.,
