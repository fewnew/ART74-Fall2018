Through reading this article, I learned that the wavelength of a light source, and what it reflects off of, determines what color we see. Each of these colors/wavelengths can be identified through three attributes: hue, saturation, and brightness. The hue is determined by the light’s placement on the color spectrum, while saturation is determined by the light’s purity, and the brightness is determined by its intensity.  Colors of light can also be mixed together in order to create different effects.  Each of the colors created come from the three primary colors: red, blue, and green.  There are two ways in which colors can be mixed: additive and subtractive.  While additive begins with no light, and light is added, subtractive begins with all light, and different lights are taken away until the desired color is visible.
These techniques/ attributions are extremely valuable to light production.  They can be used anywhere, from a dramatic opera to a rock concert.  Light is essential to setting the mood/tone for any exhibition, show, or production.  It has the power to influence the perceptions of the audience, and to draw them deeper into one’s work.
