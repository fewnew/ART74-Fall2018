	Light has been studied for many years, people have wondered if it was particles or waves of nature. Light is actually a portion on the electromagnetic spectrum that can be seen by the human eye. Light is characterized by wavelengths measured in nanometers, and the speed of wave motion in Hertz. Humans conduct light source which we turn sources of energy into light. For example electricity, gasoline, and nuclear power.
	We cannot see light itself but we can see the reflection of light off of objects and particles. It can be reflected into angles measured by the axis perpendicular to the object or surface in which the light is hitting. What is known as white light actually consists multiple colors of light defined by Newton's Prism experiment. Different hues of the light spectrum can range from purple all the way to red. Light is just an illusion to the eye as it reflects off certain objects in order to give a certain feedback that may or may not be pleasing for some people, that is way it is very important in the art and entertainment industries.
