I feel like science and art classes have drilled in the concept of color modes and the science/physics behind light well enough, haha. It was cool to learn about the differences between naturally colored light, and light being colored by filtering out some of the other colors its composed of. Additionally, the science of light being refracted. The image refracted light makes looks shifted or "bent" because the waves of light are actually also being shifted and bent.
