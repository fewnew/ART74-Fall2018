 # Understanding Light
 ## Reading Response 1
 Going into this class, I had no idea what kind of things I will be learning and when I read the first reading, I was surprised on how much more complex the idea of light is. I knew about rays and such but I never knew that there was more to it. The first thing that caught my eye is the idea of wavelengths with ultraviolets and infrared. I had no idea that such things exist. Also, the idea of having visible and invisible light is very surprising. As a creature that depends on sight, I find it important that have good eyesight.
 The reading also talked about the temperature of the lights. I find this interesting due to the fact that the color of the light has a certain temperature. I learned that the lighter the color, the higher the temperature. This is something unusual because we grew up thinking red would be the hottest due to fire. Lastly, the article talks about how some colors are able to penetrate the eye but some can’t, I think this is important to understand because of the fact that people are able to see a certain shade of color while some can’t. Also I believe that understanding the idea of light helps artist make a better piece by knowing how color and lighting matters when developing a piece.
