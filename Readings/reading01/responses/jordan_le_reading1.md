Light is invisible but can be seen by reflection.  We humans can only see visible light, otherwise known as Roy G. Biv.  Roy G. Biv consists of a white light that combines the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet(purple).  All the other lights like ultraviolet, x-rays, y-rays, infrared radiation, microwaves, and radio waves are invisible to the human eye.  All the lights are in the electromagnetic spectrum.  The lights are measured by nanometers and hertz.  When a light ray gets reflected on a wall, it brightens a certain area.  If a light ray reflects a wall at an obtuse angle, then the brightness happens close to the wall.  In other words, the light gets reflected evenly in all directions.  Issac Newton was the one who created the triangular glass prism experiment.  What it does is separate the white light into seven colors.  CDs and other types of glass show seven colors of light.  When light reflects water droplets from the sky, it creates a phenomenon called the rainbow.  When it comes to the color temperature of light, red and orange are the least hot.  Yellow is hotter than orange and white is hotter than yellow.  Blue light is known to be the hottest.  That being said, blue fire is hotter than red fire just like the blue sun is hotter than the red sun.  What makes objects have color is not the color being absorbed, it's the color being reflected.  For example, the chlorophyll in plant leaves reflect the green light and absorbs the rest of the colors.  A white shirt reflects all the colors, while a black shirt absorbs all the colors.  This makes the black shirt have a slightly higher temperature than the white shirt.  All colors have a hue, saturation, and brightness.  Hue is a type of color, saturation is how rich the color is, and brightness(value) is how light or dark the color is.  Tint is the lighter version of a hue(color), Tone is a color that combines grey and hue.  Shade is the darker version of a hue.  A colored light could change the color perspective of the original object.

I think the study of light is more about learning science than learning how to do digital art.  It is good to learn something about a particular topic.  Although I have a curious personality, I personally prefer to do the hands-on digital media.  I could see how learning something like this would help students master the things in digital media.  I learned something about the light in eighth grade, 9th grade, and BIOL 10 from last semester.  I could see by learning the science of light leads to a connection of RGB and color scales in computer software.  Reading this page about light took me a few hours and I would do as much as I can.  The readings remind me of applying knowledge to art.
