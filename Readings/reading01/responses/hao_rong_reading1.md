I've been working with the CMYK color space for a long time, but it never occurred to me that the CMY colors are secondary to the RGB color wheel. This article cleared up a lot of concepts for me and helped me make the connection between RYB, CMYK, and RGB

I find it very interesting how colored lights change our perception of color. I haven't had much experience with colored lighting and was confused to know that the shirt was actually blue. So I went back to look at the graphics once more, and then I noticed the slight green tint on the shirt when under yellow lights.

The nature of this concept means it is difficult to apply in a digital work environment, but I can see it being used to achieve unique effects when used in an installation.
