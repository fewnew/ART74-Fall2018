Overall, this reading taught me essential knowledge on how light works in terms of reflecting and bending colors. While the specifics on the actual process of light and their wave lengths triggered my interest, I found it most intriguing to learn about how light works and how it can effect the world or art and design. For instance, the part in the article where it explored stage lighting, was pivotal as the way light reflects off the foreground or background can change the whole impression of an artistâ€™s work. To focus on whether the light strikes the background to enhance the main object of attention is an important detail to keep in mind as creating a piece of work. Additionally, learning about how different watt percentages change the tones of light from warm to cool light also peaks my interest as choosing between warm and cool light in a piece can  be a huge factor in the tone of your art. As simple as creating a specific mood to your work, all depends on how the light refracts in an image and the temperature of the lighting.
	Another thing I found interesting was the information on hue, saturation and brightness. Although they are all variations of how light is produced, they too play an important role on the type of feeling you want to provoke from your design. In terms of additive lighting, the concept of mixing and blending different colors from all assortments of hues/saturations to create infinite colors, becomes really essential as the types of colors you put into your work, make your art unique. To create so many colors out of such a small palette of original colors is so interesting to me. All in all, this article really developed my sense on the way light works and really helped me understand how necessary the information is when it comes to art and design.
