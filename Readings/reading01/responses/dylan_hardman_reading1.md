Light, from the human perspective, is only a sliver of the spectrum of light waves that exist.  The spectrum of light shown in several diagrams shows that different types of light waves have the relationship of higher wavelengths having lower frequencies and vice versa.  The visible light spectrum consists of the light we are able to see as humans through how light reflects off of different obstacles.  We can see optical illusions when light is refracted through different materials. You can observe the different components of white light when it is scattered in a prism into its range of colors as done in Issac Newton's experiment or when you look at something like a CD.  Color temperature can tell you how light compares at different times of the day.

Color itself can be described by its three main attributes of hue (which refers to color shades), saturation, also known as chroma (the purity and fullness of the color), and value which refers to its brightness).  Color can also be created by mixing through additive or subtractive properties.  In additive properties, the primary colors are combined until they create secondary colors, and then mixing primary and secondary to create tertiary colors.  Subtractive properties take a different approach by making the secondary colors the primary and vice versa.  Finally, intensity of light refers to how bright the light is which can be broken down into is luminous flux and illuminance.
