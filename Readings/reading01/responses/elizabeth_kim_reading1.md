Light has different ways of being manipulated, through both the additive and subtractive model and through changing the elements within a light source. The subtractive model starts with light and uses secondary colors to subtract colors out of the source lighting. The additive model starts with darkness and uses primary colors to mix new ones. Both also use secondary colors to mix tertiary colors. Lighting color can also affect what an object appears to be. For example, a red bag may appear a dark red or even black under blue lighting.

Colors can be described by three different attributes: hue, saturation and brightness. Hue being what basic color it falls to on the spectrum, like “red.” Saturation (chroma) is how pure or rich a color looks, lower saturation means the color looks grayish. Brightness (value) is the intensity of light coming from a surface. Tint, shade and tone are also ways to describe colors based on their attributes.
