	This reading gave me a clearer understanding of what light really is. I can now see light from a scientific view. This taught me that all the light that I see is a reflection energy waves. I learned that light is characterized by wavelengths and frequency. This information was surprising because usually when people think of wavelengths, they think of sound. As frequency increases, wavelength decreases. Wavelengths in the range between 380 and 740nm characterize visible lights whereas shorter wavelengths characterize non visible UV rays. I also was able to discover how certain colors absorb and reflect light differently. Different types of light are composed of different levels of colors. This information was extremely helpful for creating art.
	This reading helps my process of creating art by helping me understand the meanings of certain terms. Terms that were used include brightness, hue, and temperature. When I use Adobe programs and design programs in general, these terms are key to creating an image. Since photography is a huge part of media art, understand how light works is important for every image captured. The temperature and positions of shadows within an image can change the feel of an image. Darker toned images have more of a grungy, mysterious feel, whereas lighter toned images have more of a refreshing and positive feel. The knowledge of lighting will lead an artist to become more proficient in creating a peice that is appealing to the eye.
