One of the more interesting properties of light is color and color mixing. All the different colors fall on a color wheel, much like colors in paints, however the rules and end results for mixing differ significantly.
When we think of the color white in terms or paints or pigments, we don’t really think of it as a color itself but rather the absence of any color. When we think of black, we often think of it as the presence of every color of the spectrum. If we were to take all the colors on the color wheel and mix them together, theoretically we would end up with black. Now if we were to take that black color and start subtracting the individual colors from it, in theory we would end up with white.
Lighting colors, on the other hand, are exactly the opposite. White is the presence of all the colors on the light spectrum, whereas black is the absence of all colors. The best example of this explanation is the famous Newton’s Prism Experiment, in which Newton shone a beam of light through a triangular glass prism. When he placed the prism at a precise angle, the white light was separated into the classic rainbow spectrum. This is because each color has a different wavelength and refract, or bend, at a different angle when passed through the prism.
