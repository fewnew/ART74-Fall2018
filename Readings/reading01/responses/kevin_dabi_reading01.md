There are different kinds of light in the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from radio waves to gamma rays and right in the middle is visible light. I took an astronomy class in my senior year of high school and I learned a lot about the electromagnetic spectrum. In number one of the reading, Nature of Light, physicists has classified it as either a particle or a wave. I’ve never heard of it as a particle but I have as a wave. I learned that there was different kinds of light and how they vary. Their waves are distinguished with speed, distance, and frequency. Gamma ray is the fastest and shortest wavelength while radio waves are the slowest and longest. There is part of the spectrum where light becomes visible to the naked eye and that’s where visible light is. This ranges from 380 to 740 nanometers. It’s amazing how there are different kinds of light but only a small bit of the electromagnetic spectrum is visible to the human sight. Though it is the only thing visible to our eyesight, we still discovered the other kinds of light that are not visible with the naked eye.
Light propagation is a cool way to make something look weird and wonky. In one of the pictures where the person is in the water, it creates an illusion that her head looks like it is not attached to the rest of her body. It is how light goes through an object and in the picture, it is water. I think light reacts way differently in the water which leads to the illusion of the person having an unattached head. This would be really cool to take different pictures with different objects. With the different kinds of content in the reading, I can see that we can create different kinds of creative artwork using these ideas.
