After reading this article about understanding light, I felt like I learned more and acknowledged more information on lighting than I originally knew. I felt like the terms used for color theory was helpful to look at because it reassured my knowledge and vocabulary of understanding the concept for light. I found it interesting to learn about how the wavelengths in light can range in nanometers. It was also interesting that the wavelengths were compared to an ocean waves movement in the electromagnetic spectrum video. The fact that we are also surrounded by several waves of light reflecting off of objects in a room made me realize how we rarely notice how connected each object really is. I find it unique that light will and can reflect on various objects, like a swimming pool or glass bottles outside.

Another video I found fascinating to learn about was from Newtonâ€™s Prism Experiment. It talked about how white light can easily change a color. Through a formula they calculated the boundaries of how the light can change the angle of the object. I personally believe that the experiments resulted into discovering more about colors through an object. The light would separate the colors at an angle to display all colors that were known in a color spectrum. From the wide range and depth of how light is discovered and used, I find it beneficial to understand the process of how light exhibits everywhere. 

I personally believe that the qualities in light are important to think about because, like most social media users today, we have the tendency to fix and edit the lighting of photos we take to make the photo stand out more. I personally find myself editing photos by changing the hue, saturation, and brightness because I want to make the photo look bright, clear, and to remember that moment vividly as possible. After reading this article, I had concluded that I never really thought about how lighting would affect objects or photos to be more visually appealing.
