After I finished reading, reading 1, I was just amazed about all the different
things there is to know about lighting and the colors. I was not aware of many
of these things. I sure learned a lot. Though I do have some questions. Some of
 the things that stood out to me was definition or well the explanation of tints
 and shades. On the reading, it says that, “tint is the mixture of a color with
 white, which increases lightness, and a shade is the mixture of a color with
 black, which reduces lightness.” That caught my attention because when I read
 that, what came to mind was the tinting of cars, you can tint the car windows
 and when someone tints their car windows it means that they are making their
 windows darker, but why is it that in the reading it says that tinting
 increases the lighting.
	I actually had no idea of all that it takes and is involved with getting the
  perfect lighting and all there is to it. I found the Newton’s prism experiment
  interesting. I see in the back of the CD’s the light, the rainbow, but I was
  not aware that it was actually the decomposing white light to colored light,
  so that was something new for me. Another thing, that I learned was about hue,
  saturation and brightness. I’ve seen those words before whenever I am trying
  to edit a picture on my phone. But now after this reading it is good to learn
  more about it and go in depth and know what each one does exactly and not just
   making a picture look better and nicer. Something else that I learned was
    about primary colors, secondary colors and tertiary colors. Reading this
    article was great and really good, I learned a lot.
