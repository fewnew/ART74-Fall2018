When the primary colors ( red, green, and blue) together compose a white color when they are mixed even if they are under a distribution. To be able to get a secondary color you will need to combine the mixtures of a primary color and another primary color. To be able to  get a tertiary color you will need to mix a primary color and a secondary color. When or If colors oppose each other in the color wheel they are usually called Complementary colors.
	Light is indeed a electromagnetic radiation force of wavelengths. Other lights that are lights but doesnâ€™t seem that they are lights because they are naked to the human eye are the lights infrared and ultraviolet. Visible lights are determined to have a wavelength between 380 and 740 nanometers. In radiation/colors, the color lights  blue and violet are considered to be slower than the color lights orange and red.
