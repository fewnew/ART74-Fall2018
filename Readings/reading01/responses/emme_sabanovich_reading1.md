Our first reading assignment based on understanding light, spoke of many technical qualities of both natural and physical light as well as theory on colors of light. For instance physical qualities of light including refraction, refection, and scattering. As well as theories on color such as RGB and CMY in regard to mixing of colors and color temperatures. There were several words explaining specifically the nature of light and how it works intertwined with color as reflection of objects.
  I believe most importantly were the theories that gave a better understanding regarding the ideas and concepts on how light attributes to coloring hue, saturation, and brightness. This was especially well explained in the diagrams used to show the way color is reflected through light in representation of stage lighting. It was also explanatory on intensity of light as well. As I read more of the article I began contemplating more on the idea of how we perceive light through reflections of colors depending on whether the environment allows objects to either reflect, pass through, or absorb light in terms of propagation.
