I found the topics covered in lessons 4 and 5 to be the most interesting things in the reading because they covered a lot of ground on colors, familiar and unfamiliar.

Lesson 4 served as a bit of a refresher course on controlling light with colors; hue, saturation, brightness, etc. As someone who's always been a natural draftsman colors were never really my territory, but some experimentation and advice from skilled friends helped me learn how to use them rather well. I'm excited to see what I can do with them in this class.

Lesson 5 however talked about stage lighting and color mixing, which I have no prior experience with. I know people who have worked tech in theater before and sort of remember them describing these phenomenons to me, but seeing it laid out on the page is really quite different. It's hard to wrap my mind around the way a secondary color like green can mix with red to create an amber lightâ€”or how blue, red and green together form an achromatic color like white. It will take some getting used to. Some of the images on the right of the article in section 5.1 seem to be in some sort of pre-production staging program. Will we be using that? I can't imagine the practical application of something like that in our coursework, but it seems fun nonetheless.
