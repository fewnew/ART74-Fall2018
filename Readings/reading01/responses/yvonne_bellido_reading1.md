Our first reading assignment was on the topic of light and understanding color. Light is defined as electromagnetic radiation within a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Light is characterized by its wavelength, meaning how long a single wave is. It is also characterized by  its frequency, meaning the speed of wave motion. Light has different physical forms like reflection, refraction, and scattering. White light is made up of all the colors in the spectrum.

Color is defined as the visual perceptual property corresponding in categories called red, blue, yellow, and others. Color has many characteristics like hun, saturation, and brightness. Hue is a designation for basic colors of spectrum, saturation is the purity of color, and brightness is the attribute of visual sensation. Tint, shade, and tone is a way to describe colors. The primary colors are red, green and blue. While the secondary colors are created by mixing two primaries and tertiary colors are by mixing secondary and primary colors.
