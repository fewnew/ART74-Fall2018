Our first reading assignment was on the topic of light and understanding color. Light is defined as electromagnetic radiation within a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Light is characterized by its wavelength, meaning how long a single wave is. It is also characterized by  its frequency, meaning the speed of wave motion. Light has different physical forms like reflection, refraction, and scattering. White light is made up of all the colors in the spectrum.
