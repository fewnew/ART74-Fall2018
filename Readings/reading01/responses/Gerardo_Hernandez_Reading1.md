I found this reading very interesting in the way our eyes perceive our surroundings. I was taught about this in highschool but never really gave it much thought. The videos has also made it helpful in order to visualise everything. Such as the video wich illustrated spectrum waves. The way the illustrator mention it in his video makes me aware of my own surrounding and how it could also be emitting waves. One would think as light to be the clear color that it is and not be made out of all the colors in the wave spectrum.
I would think that color comes just from paint or other staining substance, but once you nail it down. You tend to find out that the “paint” is actually a substance that reflects a color and absorbs other colors or vice versa. In which in return we perceive color within our eyes. Also, I always perceive the sun to be red with yellow. It's interesting to know that it actually all the colors combined. The angle and distance matter significantly when it comes to the way we perceive things. So the reason for me thinking the sun is red and yellow was due to the position I saw it in. Thus making me believe the sun is either red with yellow. Overall I won't really see colors the same and this will definitely be helpful in the years to come.
