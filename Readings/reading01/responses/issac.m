What's interesting in the reading is that not only we see the colors in pictures, but also in real life to tell the difference. For example, the water. When you see the ocean water waves a little bit, you can see the flow the ocean is doing when changing color. in my experience, I've seen this happen all the time whenever I travel across the planet.
