Reading Response: Light
Light is something that is constantly present in our lives, even at night when the sun is gone, when light is minimal – light still surrounds us: through our own electric utilities, stars and the moon. Other than our eyes, light is completely responsible for how we see the world – it gifts us beautiful colors that can solidify a gorgeous memory and even influence our mood and how we look at things. Light surrounds us completely and modifies everything it touches and yet we can’t fully see what light is; instead we see the reflections of light.
Light comes in waves as an electromagnetic radiation which can vary from either the amount of waves present or the speed of which their waves travel. To the human eye not all wavelengths are visible; the rods of our eyes process low light levels and the cones responsible for color vision. Unable to see other waves of light is not a personal short coming, but rather the range between 380 and 740 nanometers are where our eye’s capabilities reach and land. Below or higher the eye is unable to process or see them. Though human eyes are unable to detect these other lengths of light – there are other animals that can see a wider spectrum of color than we ever can, such as the mantis shrimp, the shrimp having the most advanced and complex visual system of 16 photoreceptors and the ability to see UV and polarized lights.
Light plays with colors – when a white colorless wave a light bounce and reflects off an object – the result is dispersion creating a rainbow (all of the colors that we are able to see). As previously mentioned the number of waves can affect a color – this causes the expression of different hues. Another attribute to the color of light is color temperature – with the higher the temperature resulting in the cooler and the lower the temperature presenting a warmer color.
When reading over the text my first thought was about how it had been so long since I had investigated the science aspect of light – through my last years of being an artist and applying color studies I had never once thought about wavelengths and why what mad different hues and colors. I previously knew that light was an invisible wave, but that most of my understanding of light and color came through my experience with art and design. I knew primarily, secondary and tertiary colors not because of a purely science-based education – but rather out of the challenge and constant application of making colors have a successful flowing relationship and to make it all translate.
My takeaway from the reading is to be more thoughtful of the technical and science sides of art and how I can further apply that to my pieces – or to at least gain a greater sense of appreciation. To not just want a Wacom Cintiq because it’s fabulous – but to understand why the technology is such an upgrade for artists. Understanding science can be another way to better connect to art as well – that even though art is on subjective level, that there are attributes that help pull it together and make reason as to
why it makes sense and is aesthetically pleasing. An example of other technical understanding in art is perspective.
