The reading had a lot of interesting points that I never really thought about before. One of the interesting points that I feel like I should've known about but didn’t was the difference between Primary and Secondary colors. At first, I didn't really understand what the term meant but then I realized how basic it was with certain colors being primary (red, yellow, blue) and others being secondary which are created by mixing primary colors (green, orange, purple).

Another point in the reading that I liked was Isaac Newton’s Prism experiment. I liked how he showed that white light was in fact not colorless and could produce colors. As the reading states, “White light contains a mixture of all kinds of colored light.” The example of the CD reflecting the colors is a great example of this idea. Hue was also very meaningful since it had two meanings, one being achromatic and another being chromatic. All in all, this reading had lots to learn from whether it be in colors, light, reflection and many more key terms.
