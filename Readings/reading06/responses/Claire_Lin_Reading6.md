After watching this movie about remixing music, it was really interesting to watch and learn about. I really thought that when they were playing a song, you would normally guess a mainstream song by a well-known artist, however the song was actually made entirely by someone else and that it just sounded like it was from that actual artist when it really was not. The history behind the songs and music make the inspiration of music helpful and creates a visual of where the song is coming from. I also really enjoyed the small portions that were included and made together because it also somehow connected really well. Their creativity allows artists to freely built, which is what I thought was interesting.

It also relates to how artists today find their motivation of creativity, which is really inspiring, especially when you are looking for new ideas. However, with the copyright law, there are some forms of limits for those that decide to create their music from songs made before. When the program Napster was created, a lot of issues increased because of downloading music illegally. I find the whole concept of making videos and including the music as remixes creates a strong community of appreciating the different types of music being created today. Overall, this movie was really interesting to watch because it influences a new culture and future generations of creating new content.
