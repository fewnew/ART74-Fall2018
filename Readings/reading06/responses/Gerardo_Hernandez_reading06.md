  While I was watching the movie It made me think about the music I tend to hear. I always been a big fan of remixes, either being hip hop,
electronic, or just instrumentals. In a certain way it's almost the same as a music mashup. There are many good collaborations of remixes 
from artist that are posted to youtube. They are illegal do to copyright issues but at times they can be really creative and great songs. 
Unfortunately if they ever do get many views Youtube will shutdown the video. Music is a way I use to express myself, or sometime I let 
music express me.

  Copyrighted music is a way corporations can squeeze money from others. In a way they are using a song that they have no right to but that 
means most underrated artist cant get known. I totally agree that  someone shouldnt say a song is completely theirs if it isn't it, but if
they give credits to the original creator than I say it's ok. In the end everyone has their own taste in music and being able to change a 
song they think they can make great to their expectation should not be prohibited.
