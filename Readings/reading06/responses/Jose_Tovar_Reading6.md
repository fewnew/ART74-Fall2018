After watching the movie, I had never really heard of this music mashup before. When the narrator told me to guess the song, I didn’t think it would be a mixture of different genres into a single song. The songs were very creative and it was an interesting mashup. Collaging 2 songs together shouldn’t be prohibited and should be a way to express your creativity.

Another interesting point I noticed in the video was the use of copyright. When copyright wasn’t introduced yet, artists were able to explore more opportunities and have more freedom but with the implementation of copyright, it has limited the creativity and opportunities for everyone. I can’t believe that the money-hungry companies would do this to individuals just because they wanted to get some profit out of their activities. I liked how during the video, it was stated that our future is becoming less free which unfortunately is.
