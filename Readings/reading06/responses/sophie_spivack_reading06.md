I found this movie about remixing music incredibly interesting since we experience so much remixed music in our daily lives. I found it so cool to know that songs in their original form are transformed through many different people until it sounds to perfection. I also found it cool how the movie visited the things that inspire artists to create the music they create. 

I also like that the movie touched on copyrighted music and how difficult it is for people to create their own music, morphed from other artistsâ€™ music. I have seen this effect video creators, not just music artists as their videos lack the correct music that they wished was being played. This freedom, once available to artists of all types, is now for the most part, taken away for the benefit of huge companies. Overall, I though this movie was interesting and collected an interesting aspect of the music mashup world.
