The idea of the mashup has been arouund for a long time, and this film discusses the positive and neative impacts of mashups on media as a whole.  In our society today if you look at music for instance you see mashups and remixes as subtle copies of original content which has been altered to make something new.  This idea of the altering and changing of content for artistic expression is present all around in our society, not just in music.  

This concept of remixing and mashups bring an interesting parallel to the idea of collaboration.  We as people share art and information so it that it may be recreated into something new, so that in a way your art will live on in others' works.  While you do have to worry about copyright and not blatantly stealing and redistributing someone else's work as long as what you put out isn't a direct copy then it is now your art.  Art is a collaboration betweem the ideas of many people, and remixes and mashups are one reflection of that ideea.
