I liked the film. Remix culture has been a pretty big part of hip-hop and rap
since the early 80s. I remember seeing a video about how jazz is the
grandfather of hip-hop, and by proxy, rap, since so many of the sounds coming
out of New York were jazz sample based. Even if we're just talking about music,
noting which cultures take which sounds from which times is always a fascinating
subject. I know that modern Lo-fi hip hop tends to set the mood for its tunes
by sampling English dubbed voice lines from Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo.
Both shows dealt in feelings of loss, alienation, regret and other adult themesâ€”
all emotions and feelings that lo-fi hip hop strives to illicit.

 Overall, I find the creation of new content through the recycling of contemporary
 influences super cool and interesting. Its unfortunate that copyright laws
 stifle that creativity.
