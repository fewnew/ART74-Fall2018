While watching this video this sounds like people want to really control their creations. They do not want other people using or taking their own work and calling it theirs. Well yea, I do not want somebody that is random just to take the hard work that I created and just take it for themselves to get credit for it. If they haven't done anything to help. However, I cannot say that for music. Music should be allowed to be free to the public. Why do you want to pay to listen to music. It is basically saying you don't want your music to be public you only want people that can afford your music to listen to it and that is not the case if you want popularity and plays for your music.

No one really can't copy your music because it is your own voice and they need quality proof to identify that is them actually singing that particular song. It is hard to fake a song because if you don't have the voice you really just don't have the voice to do so. This is why music should just be open to everyone because I hate paying for music and it is plain obnoxious to have people being copyrighted just to use a song for a project or for something because if they are using your song they are kind of helping you display it to other people because they are using it.
