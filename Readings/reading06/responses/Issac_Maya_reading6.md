Reading or viewing this video has shown that mashup or remix is completely wrong. 
The musics of the original composers are cut off and arranged them from two or more into something else has caught the copyright office their attentionand on their radar.
The man that made it happened could've been sued to pay money to the companies that published them to use them. It's like loaning money to people like loan sharks. What's really stupid is downloading music offline.
For example, if I wanted to download Get Stupid by Mac Dre without paying for it on iTunes, I would've found a source to download the song and keep for entertainment to myself without having to pay for it by using the money for food and water instead of buying one song for a dollar.
Without worrying the download, the government wouldn't find out. 

One of the things that shocked me was Walt Disney. He made Steamboat Willie based off of Steamboat Bill from 1926. I never knew that it as existed. 
Copyright disn't stop him from making more movies or cartoons. The reason he didn't get halted by copyright is that his films were based off of books from the past, the 19th century, and updated them into a newer version from then.
It made him famous and a became a successor. For example, he wanted to make Mary Poppins into a film by getting P.L. Travers sign a contract that gives him permission, based off the movie Saving Mr. Banks.
The last lesson I now know is if I wanted to make my own animated movie based off of from Disney, for example, it would have to be from before 1923.
