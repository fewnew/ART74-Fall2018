This movie is an excellent piece of relevant media and history; we are introduced to Girl Talk, a band whose creations directly relies on a plethora of samples from other songs to form its own. RiP: A Remix Manifesto urges an explanation and understanding as to how creativity and culture are being limited through copyrights and strict control of media (in this example, completed songs and sound files) usage.
 In the early opening of the movie, a copywriter employee of 40 years establishes the argument of constriction of open source files and other people’s creations can’t be challenged by an outside creator (someone who did not work in the files or media they want to use for their creation) with the expression that their creativity is now restrained. This scene is particularly interesting as the woman’s expressions are constantly changing and she is actively engaged in the remix she is being shown, she is amazed by the creation and enjoys it, yet still professionally asserts that while it’s creative and impressive it still maintains itself as a copyright nightmare: dependant on what songs our sounds are used and who they were created by - insinuating some producers would be more aggressively upset than others from a legal standpoint. 
The producer of Girl Talk identifies his connection to digital media and the internet (a voice over while a compilation of meme videos plays) is due to him being born during its birth - making them grow alongside each other. I highly relate to this and would credit my preference for digital media over traditional to my early introduction to the internet. I was on the internet potentially earlier than 5 years old, but that’s where my first few memories leave me to interpret. I famously enjoy reciting how downloading music used to be, through torrents on a program unlike LimeWire, that was straight up purple and green updating binary and not being allowed to go into the room when we were downloading. The recollection continues with my dad explaining sometime later that we could no longer download whatever we wanted because it was then illegalized. 
Growing up as alongside youtube, by middle school Youtubers of my age and older were already experiencing Viacom’s copyrighting on songs - Youtube encouraged royalty free songs as a result. Like the Manifest in the movie, the past will always try to constrain the future - but we continued to find ways around Youtube’s new copyright laws, pitch and speed or cutting instruments or clips of the songs would evade bot detection. The internet’s creative culture has always been innovative in this sense - work arounds were constant. 
I really enjoyed this movie, I really felt well represented as a digital artist and internet user, even if the movie focused on music specifically the messages still cross apply to other forms of digital content. It should create a bigger appreciation for people who make royalty free and open source content for people to enjoy, just as we should appreciate the people who have licenses for sale to use media.
