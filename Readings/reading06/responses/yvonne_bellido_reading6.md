For our reflection homework, we were assigned to view a video on copyright and content creation in the digital medium. Brett Gaylor, the filmmaker, talks about the start of the internet where public domains were created to share and remix. Throughout the film, the remixerâ€™s manifesto is stated with examples. The manifesto is that the future is becoming less free, the past tries to control the future, for free societies you must limit the control of the past, and culture builds on the past. It was really interesting to learn about these topics and the history behind it. It was also interesting to hear about Girl Talk, a mashup artist who is part of a music remix movement where he uses copyrighted music to make something new. 

I have always heard about copyright, but never understood what it would be protecting or affecting. There have been many problems with copyright because it has been manipulated for profit and is limiting creativity. What was interesting to learn is that fair use can help keep some free speech and defense when using copyrighted materials. Walt Disney is a great example of how remixing stories of the past have worked. He was able to become a great remixing artist and it was so interesting to watch because it has shaped our culture. Overall, this video was very informative and great to see how remixing can bring new creativity in music and culture.
