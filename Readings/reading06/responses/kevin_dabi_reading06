In the video, it talks about how the people don't want their own creations to be stolen by other people. I agree with this because who
wants their creation created with hard work and time to be stolen. It would personally break my heart if something I made that I have 
a strong emotional connection with would be stolen. No one would want that to happen to them. On the other hand,the video is about remxing
music and I think sometimes remixing is stolen. Yes, you do change a lot of things to the song but it still originated from someone's creation.
I just think we should always credit people when we use their creation in some way.

I like that the video covered the topic of copyright. Copyright is not a very talked about topic when everyone needs to be mindful of it.
It is such a big situation to be in if you copyright someone's work. It can get very serious to a point where you can get sued and go to court.
It's such a big deal in the music industry too. Although, it can get very confusing with songs that are remixed.
