After seeing the video, my whole view of glitch art has changed. At first, I thought glitch art would only be possible through the use of Photoshop or another photo editing software. I never knew such simple things like Text Editor could change the whole image into a new glitched form. I always thought of glitched images as being just random but now I see the creative aspect in them and what they offer.

Being able to see examples of the glitch art during the video was also very helpful instead of the usual text readings. This form of learning seems way more interactive and useful. The way that he was able to show us how we could alter an image into glitch art through text editor was so simple with the use of images. Being able to date bend an image through text editor was something I had no knowledge of. After seeing this video, I now have a new knowledgeable perspective in the form of glitch art and how itâ€™s created.
