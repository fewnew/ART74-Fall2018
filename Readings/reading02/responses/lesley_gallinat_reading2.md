I remember seeing an example of glitch work in an Art 1 class I took last fall.
The guest speaker copied an image to the computer desktop and then right-clicked on
the image and opened it in microsoft notepad. what came up was a huge long thread of
code with numbers and symbols. He then scrolled down to a random area of the code or url
or whatever it's called and typed in a few random words and hit enter. what
he ended up with was an image of taylor swift streaked with a bunch of pixelated
color bands over her face.
so from what I can glean from these videos, glitch art is a way of bending the
make up of a media file by opening it in non compatible programs and applications
in order to distort the file and create a new, distorted image. It's not
necessarily an error so much as a manipulation of the code, binary numbers,
whatever the file, image, what have you. Error implies the computer is not
functioning correctly, which is not the case of glitch art.
