I felt this hypermedia essay to be quite interesting. To be honest, I didn't this type of essay existed.
When I first saw that we were going to view a hypermedia essay, I thought it was going to be a written essay but interactive with gifs and links.
And while I suppose it is like that, the whole "essay" being a videp was a shock to me. The whole thing seemed like it came out of tumblr.
Not to mention, the video was based in 2009 which means that this existed almost 10 years ago and I have never heard of it which came to an even bigger shock to me.
However, while the video supposedly was "outdated", the information he gave was very modern and very informative as well.

The first thing I liked about this essay was that I was able to go back and forth with the table of contents and I had complete control. This made me think of the old pick your adventure stories from when I was a young child where you would flip to pick your story.
I would say this incorporates a vintage idea with a modern twist. The second thing I liked was that you could add notes. This adds some personalization and connectivity with the audience and makes it more enjoyable.
I didn't understand everything he said in the video as sometimes I wasn't sure if he meant technical or real life terms. This essay also continues on and at first I wasn't sure how to rewind or go back which made me uneasy of trying to visualize this application but once I got the hang of it, it became easier.
I still dont fully comprehend on how this hypermedia essay came to be or what exactly he was trying to make with glitch art but I hope to be able to create some soon with more looking over the material.
