In the hypermedia essay “Thoughts On Glitch Art,” it was amazing how this small concept turned into a large community with a lot of contributors. I thought it was very simple how the guy explained how glitch art is created through short and simple steps. I actually tried to make a glitch art of myself by downloading a picture of a dog online and following the necessary steps the guy had explained but I was not successful with it. It kept saying the my file was unsupported. I’m just going to have to keep on trying to get the results I want. I realize that it’s much more complicated than I expected from just editing letters from a notepad. I want to further learn this art and make some for myself.

I’ve played with glitch videos before by putting it on videos as an overlay or transition in after effects and making it look cool like a tv transition. I think glitch art makes pretty interesting images like having a picture of a yourself but some things may look abstract but the picture of yourself is still recognizable which is pretty amazing. It adds unique colors and patterns to the picture and it’s something I would like to learn more about.
