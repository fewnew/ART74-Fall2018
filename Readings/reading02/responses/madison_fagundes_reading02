Art 74, Reading 2

Through this reading, I learned the basis of what glitch art is; taking something familiar, and doing something unfamiliar with it.  One form of glitch art is known as data bending.  This involves moving files to incompatible apps, then allowing them to glitch and change at random.  Other forms of glitch art involve actually changing the code of an image, until it glitches in the way that the artist wants.  
Many misconceptions come along with the word “glitch”.  Many view the word as synonymous to “error”.  While the dictionary definitions match, it is not the case in glitch art.  Every glitch the computer makes is not a mistake, as it is doing exactly what it is being told to do.  Glitches in this sense are better described as “unexpected”, since changing various parts of a code can change various things about an image.  Glitch art is always intentional.
Overall, glitch art is a new, and very exciting form of art that is becoming more and more prominent.  It has great potential, and can be used across many subjects, such as politics, psychedelic aesthetics, failure, or chance.  Glitch art is the future of modern art.
