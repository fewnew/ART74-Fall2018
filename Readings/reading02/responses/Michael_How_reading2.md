  My opinion on glitch art is that it is a amazing and interesting way of creating art by changing the photo or file in a text editor in order to make changes such as color and shape. For example opening up a Jpg file in a text editor and typing into the text to modifying the image. Glitch means unexpected, causes attention to the system. Glitch has a lot of digital origin, but even so people tend to use it in other systems such as biological system. Glitch art is where an artist purposely recontextualizing glitches by databending or datamoshing.

 There are a few different ways to glitch, either a bug, waiting until glitch occurs, or you can instert them yourselves. We as humans glitch all the time on a daily basis not including digital systems such as computers, we are always recontextualizing things as users, like altering the way things should be done intentionally. I think that it is really amazing how people can edit or altering images and pixels through this idea of glitching such as databending.
