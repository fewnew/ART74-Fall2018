My opinion on glitch art is that it is a amazing and interesting way of creating art by changing the photo or file in a text editor in order to make changes such as color and shape. For example opening up a Jpg file in a text editor and typing into the text to modifying the image. Glitch means unexpected, causes attention to the system. Glitch has a lot of digital origin, but even so people tend to use it in other systems such as biological system.
