After watching the glitch art video by Nick, I though it was really interested. I actually ha don idea that you can 
just simply download an image and make it glitch just with the text editor. That is pretty cool. When I use the word 
glitch I use it as wanting to explain and say that I got an error and it did not work, but according to Nick on the 
video glitch does not necessarily an error, but it is unexpected because it is something that one does not expect and that 
catches us off guard. And now I understand. With glitch art you can make pictures, videos, files, furniture and so much more. 

Glitch art is always done on purpose. I also learned that there isn’t. A specific type of software needed to create and do 
glitch art. You can pick any kind of software and do something that you don’t necessarily do using that software. Glitch is 
always doing something the wrong way. I always wondered how glitch art was made, but with the example that Nick gave of using 
text editor is great now I am going to go ahead and give it a try and see if I am successful at it. One of the things that 
was said on the video that stood out to me was when they said how far you can get using a software and doing something that 
isn’t really meant for that.
