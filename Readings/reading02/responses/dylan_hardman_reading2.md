Response to “Thoughts on Glitch[Art]

The video essay titled, “Thoughts on Glitch[Art} brings up an interesting concept of art that I have never seen before.  What is seen as merely a screen of colors resembling a computer glitch can be seen as much more, and stands for a broader artistic movement.  

The essay explains and corrects the misconceptions surrounding glitch art as a whole which I found very interesting.  Glitch in this context has redefined the more commonly known definition.  Computers don’t make mistakes, humans do.  Whoever has the power to manipulate glitches can create very compelling works of art.  One idea brought up at the end of this video essay brought up a very interesting perspective.  Glitch art is one way we can take back a part of our digital lives.  This idea reigns true in this world where tech companies control all of the services we use in our lives, and this form of art is one way we can break free of that idea.
