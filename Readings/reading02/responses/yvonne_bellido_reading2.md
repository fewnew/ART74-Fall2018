The reading on “Thoughts on Glitch Art” was very interesting, interactive, and informative. I never knew much information about glitch art and how much of an art it can really be. I loved that it can be a way to take a familiar piece of technology and do something unfamiliar with it. Just by using a simple image a person can turn a file into art. It was amazing to also learn the definition of glitch, which is, an unexpected moment in a system that calls attention to the system. 

In the video, Nick Briz explained glitch art to be the aestheticization of digital errors by either corrupting digital data. With the many hours of research Nick has defined glitch art to be anytime an artist intentionally leverages the moment, by provoking glitches. I always wondered how this art was made and how artist got inspired. It was incredible to see that many artist are experimental with this art. Something that stood out to me from this reading was Nick saying to practice glitch everyday because it is more than how it looks. Overall, the video was very interesting and I now have a new perspective and appreciation for glitch art.
