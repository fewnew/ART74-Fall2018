Growing up with advanced technology, I personally dislike glitches. Before this class, I never knew glitch art was a thing. All along, I feel as though glitches are only mistake or the wifi acting up, I never knew that people actually do glitches on purpose. With the video, I learned that glitches doesn’t always mean error but it means unexpected. He explained how computers do not mistakes, people do. With this mindset, I find this true because we tell the computer what to do, and whenever it does something we don’t like, it’s probably us telling the computer to do things the wrong way.
	I find glitch art really interesting. I feel like people would always need both sides of things. Also I feel that it is important for artists to know what glitches are so it will be easier to fix. After watching the video, I learned the importance and the everyday use of glitch are. From not knowing what glitch art is, I feel more informed about when people do what they do and how glitch art helps.
