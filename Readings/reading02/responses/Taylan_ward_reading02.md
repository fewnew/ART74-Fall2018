This was my first time ever hearing the term glitch art. I never knew glitch art can be as simple as taking a picture of anything and manipulating it to be such a masterpiece. I have seen glitch art before by scrolling through the internet but I have never have heard the term before. It looks like a computer virus or when you crack your screen but in a more artistic and satisfying way were you want to keep your screen like that forever.

Also in class the red and blue images that you showed us in class. Was kind of similar to glitch art. Also, I learned that glitches are not always a mistake. I know that many art creators pro ably had glitches throughout their work that they just keep because it couldâ€™ve been something that they needed. I really enjoyed the video and it personally changed my mind about glitch art.
