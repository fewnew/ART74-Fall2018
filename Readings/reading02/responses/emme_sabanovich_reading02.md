My thoughts on glitch art are a bit confused at the moment there was a lot of information in the video about this particualr topic. I found it extremely interesting, and I am now curious to try and figure out the idea of making , what I assume would be a more simple type of this art as described in the video about the idea of opening a file of a jpeg under a differetn file and then moving the embedded code around in order to distort the photo image. Pushing the boundaries of social media with glitch art sounded like a plus as well. I don't much care for that sort of thing and feel it imposes a threat on personal space so anything to question their boundaries and control over personal content sounds interesting. The whole digital art thing is simply frustrating for someone like myself that doesn't speak the language. However, I am doing my best to keep an open mind about this and learn what I can to do the best I can with it. I don't just mean "glitch art " but digital art in general.
