I find the ethos of glitch artists extremely interesting. It's something that
could only exist in our contemporary world, with our contemporary technology.
As an art of "doing things the wrong way," it is almost a countercultural
movement against the assimilation and simplification of modern tech. I
like that it encourages not just artists, but everyday people to seek out the
flaws and uniqueness in the things that surround them. It seems like a
healthy practice/world view, but also a fun way to stumble across something
that may be aesthetically pleasing, or absolutely terrible. I can vibe with it.
