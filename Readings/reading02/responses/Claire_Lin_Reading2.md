Reading 2

I found this reading interactive and interesting to learn from. I felt like I learned more about what a hypermedia has to offer. After viewing all the concepts, I was able to learn more about glitch in the media and to acknowledge that the technology around glitch art has grown into a wide range of usage. From the growth of glitch art it has made its way into communities that became a common topic to talk about.

In order to make a glitch art, it is like taking a familiar piece of technology and doing something unfamiliar with which gave me an idea about how artists make anaglyphs 3D where it makes an art piece appear more dimensional than it already is. But with glitch art, it aims for different angles and various ways for an image to be seen like through an audio. I also found in interesting to learn that glitch is not just an error in a computer, but more of an unexpected experience that is called under attention. I personally found it really interesting on how glitch art was analyzed because of the different aspects that makes up a glitch art. For instance, a new media can appear in the art which calls for a new aspect to look at in a glitch.

Throughout different formats for technology that is used, such as a pdf file, mmf, and many more, it is used for the practice of glitch art and is specifically designed differently. Within each format, I personally find it interesting to learn that there are limits to making and preventing certain areas from making a glitch art, especially in politics. As for the results of looking at this throughout our everyday use, like in our social media, I enjoyed learning from this video about what I can find that people would not typically see. Overall, I thought that this video was interesting to watch and the fact that glitch art is more than just what we think it is and how it looks.
