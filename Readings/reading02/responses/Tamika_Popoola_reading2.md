Interestingly enough, this hypermedia essay has me more interested in how the inner workings/encodings of different *work*, than how to *destroy* them. like, what about a 1 or a 0 changes the shape of a waveform, the RBG channels of a section of an image, or the formatting of a section of text? I guess it could be found out/understood by glitching and experimenting, but maybe there's available documentation I can read up on.
The politics of file extensions was very interesting to think about. I never really considered the limitations of… *proprietary(?)* filetypes. Since they haven't (yet) constrained or limited me in my endeavors. For example, I've never complained about .DOC files, because Google Drive, Open Office, and all sorts of other software are capable of opening them, but thinking about it, it could be because .DOC was discontinued in 2003 for .DOCX, or, the developers for these software have to pay for a license from Microsoft. I'm not sure… but I find it interesting.
