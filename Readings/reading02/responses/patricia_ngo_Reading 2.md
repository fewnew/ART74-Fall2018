This hypermedia essay was very informative in sharing what glitch art truly is. The creator speaks about glitch art as if it was not a traditional art from, but rather a form of manipulating existing art. He mentions that glitch art has a "political" impact. Something that I was suprised by is the fact that there are so many ways to create this form of art. I did not know that there were artist willing to download bugs into their equipment just so they could make glitch art.
As a digital artist, the thought of purposefully messing with artwork that must have taken so much effort create is something that blows my mind. I find it interesting how the point of glitch is not knowing the outcome. The result of these changes are meant to caught you off guard. Media is supped to be perfected to avoid glitches so it is interesting to have artist that strive to achieve this imperfect look. These videos were very eye opening and it makes me want to try more glitch art.
