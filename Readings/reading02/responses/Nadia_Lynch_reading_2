When first entering Nick Briz’s webpage: I was interested yet skeptical for a moment – reading his posted note in the middle writing you as “u” and you’re as “ur,” in absolutely no way am I trashing his ability to spell or his legitimacy, I was more so in fact thrilled to see someone important and influential enough that we’re taking a close look and study at – write the same way that I do. I felt instantly among someone relatable despite him going for his higher education when I was still in primary school. This small behavior alone (again his writing style) put me at great ease and assurance that there are highly successful and well-defined people out there who still choose to write in a silly fashion. Not only does it convey a piece of his personality and time saving properties but also that he’s from an internet culture and time that I’m highly familiar with and grew up and evolved in.
	Briz’s page is incredibly interactive - what most notably stands out on his page other than images popping up that he’s referencing – is that they follow no framing or structural principles. The images appear anywhere and even over his Vlog and other images – this is important; the lack of structure and strict principles further emphasize his relationship with glitch art. Meaning that glitch art is free, sporadic  and everywhere – that while there are tutorials on how to use tools to achieve the aesthetic that glitch art is far more than just a how too, but that it’s personal: freeing yet vaguely specific.
	The experience of glitch art is so highly personal to Briz that when he discovered others had also been making the same kind of art – he didn’t find himself under crisis or abandoning his new highly personal art style and experience but rather to embrace it and join off with the others. This to me is an incredibly important step of being an artist, to accept that you are not possibly the only person to have thought of an approach or to bring concepts together and to then not feel defeated and erased because of this – but to instead empower yourself and continue to optimize this experience for yourself and with others. 
	Lastly what I found admirable about Briz is his ability to admit that from his very first beginnings he no longer relates or feels that his first definition of glitch art is correct. That to me is fabulous to admit that there is a constant evolution in art no matter what medium and tools we have with us. My personal experience rests that I have never tried to make a genuine glitch the way that he describes bur rather I have edited intentional glitch aesthetic into a piece.
