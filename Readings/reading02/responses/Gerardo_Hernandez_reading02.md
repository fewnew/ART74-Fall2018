I really liked the fact that you can alter files and be able to change its original format. I never really heard of glitch art before and seeing this has really opened up my curiosity. I liked the fact that an image can be altered by changing its original data from a text editor. I tried to do it myself but I really didn't get to do the same thing. I kept getting an error on my photo editor but at least it is doing something so I know this can still be done. It's interesting to see how he is also trying to give an explanation of the definition for glitch. I can see that glitch originated from technology especially in the year 1960s is where we started to have some kind of technological advancement.
I don't really think people would be able to tell if an image has been glitched using data bending thus meaning “glitch art” made from an editor software can also pass as glitch art for me. I can see why it still won't be able to pass as glitch art based on the way it's made, but I think that the final piece is what counts and not the tool or method you used to make that piece. Regardless I can still accept the fact that glitch art can only be made by databending anything else can still be a great piece of art.
