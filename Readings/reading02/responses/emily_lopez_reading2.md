###Glitch Art 

Listening to Nick Brees talk about his work was extremely interesting because you are able to understand not only what Glitch Art is, but you are able to listen to how he found his process and the obstacles he overcame in order to become successful. Art is a difficult to understand and define because there are so many different forms of it, Brees demonstrates this with his example of his Glitch Art. I personally had never heard of or seen Glitch Art but am not very interested in the subject and will definitely be looking into it more. 

The way he put together his video essay was very unique, and I had honestly never seen such an interactive page before. When you first went onto the page you almost feel like it is out of date, and probably will not work the way it should. But once the videos begin and things start popping up on the page, I was amazed at how unique and detailed the website was. Again,, this is something I had never seen but am eager to understand how it is done.
