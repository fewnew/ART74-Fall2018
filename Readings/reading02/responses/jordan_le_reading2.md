In the preface, Nick Briz introduced himself as a digital media artist.  He is from Chicago, Illinois.  Briz explained the brief idea of glitch art and said when it came about.  He explained how to do glitch art with the use of a jpeg file.  Nick said glitch art is not an error nor a glitch because the art being manipulated in an awkward way is intentional.  A glitch is not an error(a syntax error which makes the code not runnable), rather a logical error(runtime error).  A logical error is when the code doesn't work the way we expected, thus glitch art can happen unintentionally.  Nick Briz lastly explained how glitch art would affect society, the purpose of using glitch art, and the encouragement of practicing glitch art.    

I think Nick Briz's videos about glitch art was interesting.  The background matched the topic, as well as the pop-ups appearing with the 
video.  The pop-ups leads to a website when clicked-on.  Basically, the things that happened during the video does require some programming skills, which relates to digital media art because on how it combines programming with creative art.  There's a shortcut key called the space bar, that pauses the video.  It's interesting to have a pop-up guide to click on the parts you left of.  That would make things easier and mix computer technology with creativity like sophisticated creative websites.  I see glitch art similar to street art, but in a digital way.  Both could be used to vandalize someone's property.  Glitch art may be something that would ruin people's work, but it actually expresses art in a different way.  It is not the type of art that matters, but mainly the intention matters.  If the type of art is offensive, then it is not okay to spread it to the public.  Glitch art is digital art that has been contorted from the original picture.  This type of art can be worked with either photoshop-like software or programming like software.  It's not my favorite type of art, but it's at least something when it comes to creating ideas.
