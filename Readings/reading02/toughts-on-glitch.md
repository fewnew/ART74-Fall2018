### Reading :two: The video regarding glitch art was very interesting although extremely confusing in terms of how exactly to go about step by step making glitch art for someone inexperienced with doing so already. The part that stuck out most to me was when he explained the idea of bringing up a jpeg image under a different sort of file with an embedded code of some sort and then changing it somehow by moving around letters and numbers to then distort that image or photo. However, I am not sure of how to do something like that either or go about it but very interesting in trying it, I'm sure something like that would be considered very easy to do for someone of his skills with the computer and computer programming.  I like the idea of questioning boundaries  and social media since I myself think it is a big waste of time and poses a threat on ones' personal space.  I'd be interested in seeing exactly how a friend of his posted glitches within a social media as mentioned before they "fixed" it. The thing that frustrates me about digital art is that it is restricting for me in the sense of not being familiar with computers and programming or having the desire to enough to keep it from limiting my artistic expression, although I am trying to stay open minded through the frustration.
