The thesis behind video art seems best communicated by the quote from Radical
Software: "Power is no longer measured by land, labor or capital, but by access
to information and the means to disseminate it." We can see video artists
making such plays for power in Chris Burden's commercials, or in a more
modern sense, things like Metal Gear Solid 2 and the Eric Andre Show. Early
video artist became aware of their medium's ability to condense a massive
amount of information into something short and compact, and then ship that
information to a wide and willing audience. It is not unlike the image-sharing,
social media drunken culture we live in today. They reveled in passing on the
DNA of society just like us. In a sense, video art pieces are memes.
