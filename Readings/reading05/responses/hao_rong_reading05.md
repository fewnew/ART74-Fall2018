I think the idea of seeing video as a medium of art is fundamentally flawed. Video is nothing more than a sequence of frames. Whatever that can be done with video, can be done by drawing the individual frames, such as a flip book. The "video" being discussed in the essay refers to videos captured by video cameras, as opposed to any "motion pictures". There is a major difference. In this sense, video is mostly used as a tool of documentation. But what the viewers see in the video may not be the whole truth, or contain any truth at all, for the editor has total control over what they want the viewers to see. This way, video becomes a tool for self-expression, a tool to spread a certain ideology, like all other forms of art.

Video isn't any different from photographs or drawings, because you don't see what they don't want you to see. This technique existed long before video became a thing, but became much more influential because video is so much more relatable than a still frame. Like AR, video allows the viewer to partially experience a scene from the pasts. This might be a reason why AR and VR are developing so quickly, because these tools can empower artists to even more immersive video art.
