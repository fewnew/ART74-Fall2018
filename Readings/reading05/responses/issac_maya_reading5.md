From the reading, the author of the article is right about one thing; television is the power of cultural production. But television
can also be used as messages to broadcast signals domestically in the 1950s and it still does today. But in the present now, the signal can be
broadcasted globally to spread the word. Another thing is that video equipment were made so that people can use them to make videos of
their own instead of using the equipment that people used to launch broadcast cameras for television. But instead of broadcast television network,
they used the internet instead which is a great source to broadcast. 

What is amazing about the article is that they mentioned about guerilla television. A group of rebels used television to broadcast war-video
like videos to send messages against domination, going places where cameras had never been drawing much attention. I never knew back in the 1960s
televisions were first used as videos installations to project galleries, which was actually a good idea at the time instead of using an
old movie projector. Video art became a success when they used contemporary culture, political movements, war propagandas, global trade, or other uses
for it. And it is still happening today with television is used as a power source for cultural production.
