   It was interesting to read about some of the history of the topic video art in the aricle we read titled,
"Busting the Tube: A brief History Of Video Art," written by Kate Horsfield. I reviewed some of the specific pieces of
this type of art dating back to the early seventies specifically in the video art clips of Jonas. Although I personally found 
repetitive drumming sound in this peice a bit grooling I understood the dynamics of it to some extent in regard to the message 
that was being given through this specific piece. However, my personal interpretation could be completely off from that of the
artist that made it. Perhaps she herself had no blaten explanation behind her art to begin and simply let it unfold in a more 
abstarct way as she tends too. This is what I love most about art actually, it is an expression that speaks to others in a 
way that only the viewer can percieve regardless of any previous intentions the artist may have had, it truly is all about 
perception. 
   While reading more about the brief history of this particular type of art, I couldn't help but think of music videos. 
Music videos are a perfect example of video art, the way they display a message of images and sound in an obvious artistic 
approach. I enjoy the way sounds and images alike can intertwine in ways of manipulation through distortion and color with 
vidoe art, giving it a greater ability to bring art to life in a sense. Some of my most favorite musicians involved with 
creating awesome video art these days, in my opinion, are both Florence and the Machine and Bat For Lashes.
