It made me realize the different ways videos can actually be represented as art. I really didn't think about considering videos as art until I was reading this article. It made me think of music videos and how their music and visuals can combine together to create an art piece. Another one would be creating montages of video games that are posted religiously on Youtube. We are exposed to these kinds of videos everyday yet I hardly thought of them as art. Now everytime I see a video posted on youtube I will remember how it can be perceived as an art form. I think most if not all videos can be represented as art regardless being just a movie or documentary. In the end everyone will have their perception of the art piece.
	
	I like the way technology was able to bring up a big moment in history. It is something most people take for granted these days. To have the ability to record at a high resolution and in color kinda blows my mind. Amazing how technology has evolved to. This way everyone will have a chance to represent their own videos and share them to the rest of the world. This in a way gives us a variety when it comes to our entertainment. We won't be forced to watch the point of view of one director but of everyone else regarding different backgrounds.
