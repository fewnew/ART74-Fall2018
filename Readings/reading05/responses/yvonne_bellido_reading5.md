From reading this article, I learned more about video art and itâ€™s history. It was interesting to learn about how the television in the 1950s had much popularity and power in American households. It created a lot of social acceptance and rejection of issues and genders. For example, many people of color were not seen on screen or seen as important to the marketplace. During this time corporates would hide the real truth of what American was going through, like the Vietnam war. 

Much change came when video equipment was created and became accessible to everyday people. They had to ability to truly document what was happening around them and in the world. It was also amazing to see how video digital editing came about and revolutionized post-production. Overall, It was cool to see how video art evolved and got to what we have today. This has always been something I wondered about and it was amazing to learn how these new technologies affects people from the past.
