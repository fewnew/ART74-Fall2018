  After finishing reading 5, I thought it was really interested to learn about how video art came alive and the history behind 
it. To me it is interestign how when television first came out and all the impact that it had. From my understanding if one 
were to watch television, the things being shown on television where not exactly being truthful and honest. They would hide the 
truth and they would try to make things seem better than what they really were. But when video equipment became accessible 
people would make documentaries about what was going on around them and curewntly happening around the world and would show 
the truth behind it all and would not sugarcoate things like on television. 
  I enjoyed reading about the history of video art and the equipment. Specially to read about when the first equipment came out 
and how it was black and white. It is understandable that during that time noteveryone coukd afford that equipment. It is also 
cool to see how the video equipment kept evolving, changing and getting better.
