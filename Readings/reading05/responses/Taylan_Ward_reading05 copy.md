By reading this amazing reading I learned some new things about our history of art video and who it affected at that time. It said that women were the ones who bought certain household items, accessories or anything that was useful to them because of the advertisement that were portrayed on televisions. Another thing that came across and seemed to interest me was when they talked about how people of color wasn't viewed in advertisement back then. They didn't really have a part in video art back then. That means they were excluded from all type of advertisement, marketplace and etc that has to deal with the source of videos. They weren't the target or the audience they wanted rich or mainly people that were white to be the target and the audience for what they were portraying and selling.

As well, things that were put on or shown on television were very biased and had its own point of view or perspective. This means what is shown on television only has one side and not the other. This means it only wants to believe in only one certain perspective and view. The people that had the money and power were the ones that were able to get their point or thir view across on television.
