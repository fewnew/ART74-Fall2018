  From reading this article, I thought it was insightful and relevant to how videos are created today. I found it important to analyze and remember the activism the world had and has faced. The fact that our society was in a constant change and still is today, resulted with social norms and stereotypes. As soon as these were shown on TV, it showed different aspects of people were being represented, such as a woman's role in a household. Due to the fact that women were seen that way created a set vision of how they should be in real life. I also agree with how they created videos would reveal the message of what is actually happening in real life.

  I found it really interesting that in order to grab an audienceâ€™s attention, video activists would make videos of social and political events. With this in mind, it was an entry point for artists to show their purpose of making the videos. As new artists create their vision through videos and art, this transition has made art become more alive and thought of rather than a simple piece of art. I find it really fascinating with how our society grows with technology, art also follows. The development is personally inspiring to see because you get to understand the whole concept and idea of it. In conclusion, the amount of success that was seen with video art is also inspiring to hear about.
