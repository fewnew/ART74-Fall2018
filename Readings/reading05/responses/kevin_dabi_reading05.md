It was interesting reading and learning about the history of Video Art in the article. It really is amazing how influential video art can be. It forms a conversation in communities like politics. It amazes me how a video can be so controversial nationwide and for some, worldwide. For example, artists like Childish Gambino and Kanye West both have made controversial music videos where they present how reality is in their own sense. In Childish Gambino’s “This is America,” both the song and the music video showed very graphic images that has happened throughout America and how the media quickly covers it. Another one was Kanye West’s “Famous” where the artists referred to various other artist and famous figures like Donald Trump and Caitlyn Jenner. The video angered many as it was criticised for showing these famous people being naked without their consent. It is crazy how video has been made a medium in art that significantly impacts the nation. Since the media has been exponentially increasing in popularity, many people are seeing these videos every single day.
