After the reading, it was nice being able to learn about the history of Video Art. I never really thought of video art as being something political but now I can see how it can be fully political. For example, in some music videos like “This is America” by Childish Gambino, he sends a political message to everyone about the unjust racism occurring towards African Americans through methods such as police brutality. The message that is sent through these music videos are very clear and thoughtful. I also enjoyed the little quick facts that were thrown in the reading like how in the 1950;s, over 85 percent of households had a TV.

I can’t help but think of Youtube as the main reason for video art. All the hundreds of thousands of content creators make art through their videos and express it to the world in a very accessible fashion. Instead of getting fed lies through mainstream TV, we can actually hear people’s opinions through creative websites such as Youtube.  In conclusion, video art will forever be here with us and it will keep on growing with us as well.
