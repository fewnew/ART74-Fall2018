As an amateur filmmaker, it is interesting for me to see where the art of film and video making has been.  Technology has brought video making to the masses and has allowed for the accessible use of film as an art form different from the start.  The creation of videos often was very expensive and even still is to this day for high quality equipment.  From my own perspective using DSLRs and phones with video capability, I found it fascinating to both see how all of the resources we have no came to be, but also how they were used before now.
Above all video is an art, and art has been used for many purposes.  Entertainment is the obvious one, but it is also used widely for activism as shown in the article.  The video medium allows for the techniques of many others which makes it so unique from other mediums.  This is why video making has become so popular over the years as technology has pushed the art forward with its now widely available resources.
