	Amidst the 1960’s a powerful sense of unity was struck; uniting people far and wide to not only defend creativity and creation but to also encourage and strive for it. Creation was under fire in the battlefield of uniform and traditional while younger generations were striving for a wider sense of creative freedom within society, the 60’s created new ideologies and cultures while using art as their ammo. With such a prime climate to explore that already was naturally transitioning, the rise of a new medium came comfortably - video media. 
	Video was in an abstract plane - it was between communication media (news broadcasting) as well as artistic expression. These two components giving video media an incredibly strong advantage by giving it a far larger scope of audience all while allowing for a scope to be as narrow as someone’s gender, sexual orientation or race. Even with the mass ability to reach audiences and targeting, the value of video media continued with how easily it was mass produced - allowing profit and production costs to be additional movitavor for creation.
	Despite the success and new frontier, video media was still facing obstacles and challenges - by the 80’s it was still considered an alternative form of broadcast - not yet seen as it’s own art form and medium. Fortunately by the 80’s, expression through editing was being far more utilized: masks, fades, wipes, collages and more. Post production became an element that further continued to define the video medium.
	My personal background with editing and video started incredibly young (Thanks to my parents for always introducing my siblings and I to technology). We had a video camera and would make our own shows - quickly figuring out rather than having to shoot continuously, we could just make cuts in recording instead. As I grew, I continually filmed and learned editing as basic Windows Movie Maker (WMV) evolved - learning how to animate with WMV and MSpaint. I loved animating but later just never grew into using Adobe Animate, but instead playing around with Adobe Premiere. Premiere is a deep love of mine, there is always a new way to approach or try something. Though they are different processes - animation and film recording/editing - I found the process very alike. I was always creating a visual process and controlling how it would be viewed. I love video editing and filming.
