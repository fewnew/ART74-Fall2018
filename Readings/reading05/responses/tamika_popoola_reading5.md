Similarly to how all art is political, all video art is political too. The personal is the political. While television is a medium capable of reaching the masses, does video-art get shaped or censored by broadcasters, executives, and the need for funding, I wonder? I’d imagine that today, social media and YouTube make it easier to transmit videos as you intend for them to be seen. We’ve moved from the days of two channels and a uniform set of shows that would shape us all the same way at the same time, thank god, but the same giants, or conglomerates from the old-media space have found their way into the online space, which used to be more niche. Now, the same uniformity is happening all over again.

Similarly to how I described the niche early 2000s as the place where all the video art was, I feel like on a larger scale, the same could be said for screens and monitors in art galleries, as well as indie film festival showings. There, there are no execs, funding, ads, or media guidelines to consider.

Video art can not only be used to capture more performance-based artworks, but artists can explore the medium itself, and the digital or analog workings of video and sound,
