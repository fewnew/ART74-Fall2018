After reading the first page of the article, it was amazing how internet was created. The net was used to communicate between people and other computers
in different parts of the world. 
Net.art had amazing ambitions to connect with and exploiting the internet via email, weblinks and others. It's astounding that net.arttalk and work independently
of art world institution without being marginalized. 
Of course Eastern Europe and Russia were still a bit behind to catch up with the internet connecting to the rest of America, especially the planet.

Even so, between in '94 and '98, many art-oriented communites are formed to make net.art more deviant with subcribers to mailing lists. What really amazes me is that CNN can become 
a giant juggernaut that can trample and be colonized by the net, figuratively. But what bothers me is financial possibilities. They're these scams that can make someone rich when the point of it is to
capture their information and use it and it's called identity theft. That has always become a big issue when one watches a video or skipping the next page when a mysterious money scam pops up.
