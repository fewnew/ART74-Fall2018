  This topic instantly grabs my interest from the position of already being somebody who participates in "Net Art," specializing only in digital art. While my experience felt really new (drawing on a graphics tablet then uploading to art sites) - there were generations above me who had been pioneers long before me. Watching digital art and net art grow (and of course the growth of technology) is something I immensely appreciate and have gratitude for. With ever app update or new software published or resurface of memes - art is always so quickly established and linked into every movement. Art is the human experience: especially noted when find ways to make art with tools that are not built for such.
  The "old" internet is something I have vivid memories of and catch myself feeling old by already having, "back in my day," prepared when speaking to younger generations who are deep in the internet. I feel like the old internet was such a right of passage, going through telephone lines and waiting minutes for pages to load - opposed to the know (amazing) instant upload speeds and connectivity. This mass speed in which the internet grows also creates a rapid sense of decay. Seen especially in Apple's Macbook series, you see that Macs past a certain age become classified vintage by support (currently anyhting before 2013...so anything 5+ years old). I find this a very interest aspect of digital technology as well as net art/digital art - how quickly things will be coated in vintage dust - simply by being created on a specific type of software or from the process it was born on.
    Part of those vivid memories of the old internet, much time before Adblock had been an offered service (I'm talking like 2004+), were the basic HTML websites. They were easily identifiable between other websites that perhaps looked more polished at the time (lets say a site like Yahoo or Google). These HTML websites always seemed to have so much more freedom in terms of design and content. These were often utlized (and continue to be) by teachers, professors or hobbyists. Heck - a webpage we used to by stuffed animals all the time from is STILL HTML the way it was back then. I think this is such a unique aesthetic and very sweet - but also an important relic to reference (the old html webpages). As we continue to modernity we find ourselves always following smooth and efficient design, conscise and sleek...minimaist. I really feel a huge sense of creativity comes from chaos while design is what brings us harmony. 
    My last point with HTML comes from webpages that lowkey...highkey inspired today's web designers. Sites like Neopets, Myspace, Gaia and more, were all websites that allowed the users to personalize their bios if they had the patience to learn and work in HTML - giving you extra respect and cool-kid points if you had a sick ass bio. This young interactin with HTML is monumental for existing on the web - almost like a history course for the internet. By 6th grade I understood the basic types of things like <b>/<i>/etc etc. Though it's an easier code to read it still has it's challenges, something that's great to see is code and html being taught to young kids. I wish that had been me!
