I see that the 90 years was when artist had started creating and using codes, web browsers and other forms to create art with. Before those days people had to basically use a paint brush or handheld tools to create art. It is so satisfying to see that we can finally use online tools to create art with. To me it is very amazing and still difficult to use because I am very new to this concept. However, another good thing about creating art online is that it is way easier to share and get feedback from artist in a quicktime because you can easily via send it.

Now throughout the world we use this type of art as for anything. We can use it as propaganda, we can use this for campaign work for companies or for elections. It is funny because this art has been very useful because you can almost do anything and construct anything with these tools and people are always finding different and different ways to use them and it is very amazing to see all of the outcomes that they can come up with.
