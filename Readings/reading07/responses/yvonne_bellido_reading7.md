From reading this article, I learned more about the web and internet art. It was interesting to learn about the net.art term which meant communications and graphics, email, texts, images referring to and merging into one another. Art made from artists back in the day was really interesting because they used code. Our digital inventions have improved so much since then and have made sending an email so simple. Net art in a way seems like a glitch art. These types of art forms have expanded and developed over time. It was very interesting to read about the art history of the web.

This was also a start of artists creating work with web browsers and codes. Many became popular from it and worked with companies. It was great to see the many old computer screen photos of how this new art looked to people in the past. It is very interesting to see how technology in art has transformed. The internet has become more accessible to people and now so many people can learn and appreciate this art.
