I find it funny how net.art started entering our conversations though a corrupted email message. It was also interesting to read back on how communication was held between these earlier computer artists.

I didn't consider the (once) limited amount of domain suffixes was in part to limit or monopolize URLs. It makes more sense now that I think about it though. Today, we have so many domain suffixes. It seems like anyone with the right server can just rent out domains.

To admit, a lot of the stuff in this reading feels like some kind of virtual Dada-ism in that it makes little/no sense to me, in a "why?" kind of way, but it probably all has some more grandiose message on technology itself and the world that surrounds it.
