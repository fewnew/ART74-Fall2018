After reading this article, I found it really interesting to learn more about the web. I would have never known about the net.art because of how it defines itself as talking about art and communicating through it online. It was really interesting to see the photos that were also included in this article because it reminded me of how computer graphics were shown from before. As the Internet became a dominant domain for people to use, people would take this resource to their advantage and would focus on presenting the history for Internet Art. As companies would create pages to display art, it created a community to follow along to what the media would show. Artists were also able to collab with each other about new art pieces to present for everyone to see online. 

In a way, this allowed artists to create their own version of what type of artwork comes to mind and the fact that net.art was different in 1999 that had the iea to “pend popularity and relevance” was interesting to hear about because you would not normally think about how artwork would be presented immediately and more into being thought out to become popularized. I find it really interesting to see how technology has transformed and the way it is interactive with people who have a similar interest in art, along with much more. Compared to Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook, you really see how much art could be displayed on the web versus using a non popular website to communicate virtually about a an art piece and projects.
