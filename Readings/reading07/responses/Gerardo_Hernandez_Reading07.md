It was really cool to find the ways how digital media art was starting to become. I think that code is and will forever be useful to improve the daily task within our lives. Some of the images shown within this article is actually very fascinating to me. I remember my dad had an old windows 98  computer with that particular OS and it just reminded me of a game it had that looked something similar like that. This is really one of those errors that was good.
regardless being from the year of 1997-99 I still think this is really fascinating and have a sense of a modern touch. Maybe has to do with the colors or orientation of the images themselves.
