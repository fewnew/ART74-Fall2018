A new type of art was discovered in the 90s. A new type that involves using the online web browser, coding, etc. to create artworks. It is
a very complex tool to make art but it was fascinating, especially coding. You have to memorize and be familiar with all of the commands in
order to make them do things for your artwork. You are basically commanding a computer to do a job for you. 

In my experience of learning code in this class, I had a tough time trying to be familiar with code. It was hard for me because you have to
be really specific with your commands and everything has to be organize and in order. My coding was neither. It was hard trying to fix it but
I got around it and successfully finished my work. It just got really confusing but it was definetly interesting and fun.
