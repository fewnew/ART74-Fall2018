The concept of net art adds a different meaning to what art can be.  In the early 90s with the rise of net art, people used coding to create works of art very different than what is conventionally known to the averae populous.  From a person who has had some programming experience, it was interesting for me to see code in a new context.  For code as an art form is very different from code as a tool for creating tools.
It is easy to understand why this style of net art became so popular amongst 90s artists because of the accessibility of the medium.  Computers at the time were becoming very widely used and this allowed for artists to take advantage of this.  From my own memory I recall the times that I used to draw on the computer using MS paint, but this idea of net art brings about an expansion upon that artistic freedom I didn't know about.  It will be interesting to see what technology will be used in the future by artists in a way it wasn't intended.
