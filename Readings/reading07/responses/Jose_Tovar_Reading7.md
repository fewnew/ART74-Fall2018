After reading the article, it was interesting to see how the net web works. Seeing how artists used code for art back in the day was really interesting. Weâ€™ve made such an improvement in our digital art websites that it seems totally different. Seeing how the email was through an accident was pretty weird since it led to a bunch of opportunities for art in the web.

Net art seems very cool and could also be related a bit like glitch art. Anyone is pretty much able to do whatever they want in the internet and can make whatever they want and still call it art. Overall, a very interesting read on the history of the web with art.
