Through reading this recent article on web art, otherwise referred to as "net.art," I was first of all reminded of how much 
technology itself has changed so drastically over the last few decades. The way the firt, said to be "net.art" was 
brought about was occuring though an email which at the time emails were a huge break through themselves when innernet first started. 
As computers have drastically changed from what looked like a huge washing machine for clothes to now so poratble, quick , and fast
advanced machinery to communicate in a number of ways including artistically, so to have the effects and possiblities of what computers and the web can do
in terms of creating what could be considered more ellaborate works of net.art. 
I can see how what we learned of as "glitch art," is a type of net.art or even more so what is is in terms of definition overall
the way art is created via web using code and urls to create certain works of digital art that would not otherwise even exist without 
the grounds of the web for it to exist within. It creates a whole new language and world though technology that I struggle yet to understand 
but find it fascinating none the less. For myself the coding is very difficult I find it amazing how some people can be so 
patient with the trail and error of creating, what in a sense is a dilog of its own, behind these works of net.art creating from 
scratch like that. I mean technically speaking the other digital art you see on the web that isn't created through code, also couldn't exist 
without the web, but the coding and all is what actulally makes evryhting on the web. What I mean is that is is nice to be able to 
create things on the web as art without having to do the technical coding behind it. Learning about coding and how technicle and 
tedious it is you gain more respect for it as well.
